    <h1 class="featured-header">Code of Conduct</h1>
    <p>
        The Atlanta Java Users Group (AJUG) dedicated to providing an outstanding
        conference experience for all attendees, speakers, sponsors, volunteers and
        organizers involved in DevNexus (GeekyNerds) regardless of gender, sexual
        orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, financial
        status, hair color (or hair amount), platform preference, or text editor of choice.
        We do not tolerate harassment of GeekyNerds in any form. Please treat your fellow
        GeekyNerds with respect, regardless of the context you’re interacting with them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Harassment is not appropriate for any conference venue... We expect all
        GeekyNerds to follow the Code of Conduct during the conference. This includes
        conference-related social events at off-site locations, and in related online
        communities and social media. GeekyNerds asked to stop any harassing behavior
        are expected to comply immediately. GeekyNerds violating this Code of Conduct
        may be expelled from the conference without a refund, and/or banned from future
        AJUG events, at the discretion of AJUG
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples of harassment include offensive comments, verbal threats or demands,
        sexualized images in public spaces, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography
        or recording, sustained disruption of sessions or events, and unwelcome physical
        contact or sexual attention. Speaker presentations fall under this category and
        should not use images or examples that would violate the code of conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
        GeekyNerds must remember that the DevNexus organizers and volunteers are not
        trained conflict resolution specialists, nor are they security or law enforcement.
        DevNexus organizers and volunteers will immediately escalate issues around safety,
        violence, or similar situations to facility staff or law enforcement.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the protection of GeekyNerds, AJUG will never put its organizers or volunteers
        in the position of trying to assess whether or not an incident merits escalation.
        If there is any doubt, we will escalate incidents to the appropriate agency
        immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>Incident Resolution</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            All GeekyNerds agree to treat each other with respect, regardless of whether
            you are in a session room or at the facilities.
        </li>
        <li>
            Simple disagreements should be resolved between the individuals
            concerned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Harassment or more serious issues should be escalated to a DevNexus
            organizer or volunteer. That person will immediately contact an AJUG Board
            member who has the responsibility to assist in resolution.
        </li>
        <li>
            GeekyNerds suffering outright assault or extreme harassment should contact
            the facility staff immediately, or a DevNexus organizer if they're
            nearby. That person will immediately escalate the issue to the facility
            staff or law enforcement as appropriate.
        </li>
    </ul>
