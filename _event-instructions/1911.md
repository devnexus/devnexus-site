title: Developer To Architect - Full day workshop
---
Neither a laptop nor special software is required for this workshop though your modeling tool of choice (Spark, Visio, OmniGraffle, etc.) is welcome for the exercises. Of course paper and pencil are very effective too and frankly recommended! We will work in pairs or teams. A laptop will be helpful for presenting exercises in class and taking notes but is not required. That's it! Well, and a willingness to participate!
