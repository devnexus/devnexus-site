Developer without borders, both geographically and technically. Active as a consultant with a focus on Java technologies.

Next to that I am a trainer and mentor who loves to share not only knowledge but also passion for our craft. I do this through mentorships (codingcoach.io), guiding students at my alma mater or just helping strangers on Twitter and StackOverflow.
