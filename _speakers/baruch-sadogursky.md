bio: 'Baruch Sadogursky (@jbaruch) did Java before it had generics, DevOps before
  there was Docker, and DevRel before it had a name. He started DevRel at JFrog when
  it was ten people and took it all the way to a successful $6B IPO by helping engineers
  solve problems. Now Baruch keeps helping engineers solve problems but also helps
  companies help engineers solve problems. He is a co-author of the "Liquid Software"
  and "DevOps Tools for Java Developers" books, serves on multiple conference program
  committees, and regularly speaks at numerous most prestigious industry conferences,
  including Kubecon, JavaOne (RIP), Devoxx, QCon, DevRelCon, DevOpsDays (all over),
  DevOops (not a typo) and others. After a tenure of eleven years in JFrog DevRel,
  Baruch is the Principal Developer Productivity Engineering Advocate at Gradle. '
