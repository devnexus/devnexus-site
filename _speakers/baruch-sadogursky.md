bio: Baruch Sadogursky (@jbaruch) did Java before it had generics, DevOps before there
  was Docker, and DevRel before it had a name. He started DevRel at JFrog when it
  was ten people and took it all the way to a successful $6B IPO by helping engineers
  solve problems. Now, Baruch keeps helping engineers solve problems, but also helps
  companies help engineers solve problems. He is a co-author of the "Liquid Software"
  and "DevOps Tools for Java Developers" books, Java Champion and CNCF Ambassador
  alumni, serves on multiple conference program committees, and regularly speaks at
  numerous most prestigious industry conferences, such as DevNexus, DevOpsDays, Voxxed
  Days, Devoxx, DevRelCon, Kubecon and QCon. Today, he's taking care of developers
  at TuxCare.
