bio: "The future of IT is in the AI innovations in the cloud. ☁️ My overall goal is
  to enable complex solutions to maximize the benefits and outcomes for organizations.
  Providing innovative solutions while controlling costs is my passion and highest
  value.\r\n\r\nI am an innovative thought leader that provides organizational leadership
  focused on taking on challenging initiatives. Actually, I am driven by complex challenges.
  I am most effective in up front project architecture, strategy, and planning, then
  leading projects to completion with the delivery teams. I enjoy building both technology
  strategy and the teams to provide effective results. I am seasoned in breaking down
  complex solutions and workloads into smaller and more manageable components. I can
  go on and on about common keywords here like domain driven design, microservices,
  design patterns, observability, cloud enablement, IaaS, PaaS, IaC, CaC, CI/CD, DevSecOps,
  automation, Azure, GCP, and AWS. However, the point being is that I have experienced
  the wrong and right ways to approach large solutions. I know to use what technology,
  where to use it, and the level of teams to get the job done most effectively. Also,
  I have learned from project mistakes and failures. I strive to iteratively improve
  myself, my teams, my projects ,and the organizations that I am working with.\r\n\r\nI
  am a humble technologist with a passion for serving my clients. I am the neighborhood
  and family \"IT Guy\". Also, I love to assist with local non-profits. I am a loving
  father with a wonderful wife and twin boys. Lastly, I am Linux hobbyist and huge
  into saltwater fishing."
