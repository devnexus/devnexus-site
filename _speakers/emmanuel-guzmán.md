bio: Software engineer with over 9 years of experience in Oracle technologies and
  software development. I began my career in infrastructure and middleware, specializing
  in high-availability environments, virtualization, security (SSL), and application
  servers. Since 2020, I have fully focused on software development, working with
  Java and Oracle APEX. In addition, I am co-founder of the Costa Rica Java User Group
  and creator of the blog oracle-max.com, where I share knowledge with the community.
  My passion for continuous learning led me to become part of the Oracle ACE program
  as an Oracle ACE Pro, and I am always eager to explore new technologies, especially
  in the field of AI
