bio: "I am Anitha Dakamarri, a seasoned IT professional with over 16 years of experience
  in the field of information security. My journey began with a Master of Computer
  Applications from Jawaharlal Technological University, which laid a strong foundation
  for my career. Over the years, I have honed my skills in various domains, including
  threat modeling, application security assessments, and network security assessments.
  My work experience spans across reputable organizations like DFIN, USCELLULAR, and

  robust security frameworks. I am a Certified Information Systems Security Professional
  (CISSP) and hold several other certifications such as CEH and CHFI, which reflect

  extends beyond technical assessments; I have also initiated and conducted security
  awareness workshops to educate and empower others. As a mentor, I am eager to share
  my knowledge and experiences to help others navigate the complexities of the IT
  security landscape.\r\n"
