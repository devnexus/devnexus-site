In his constant drive to test better, faster, and cheaper tomorrow than today, Leslie was an early adopter of Specification by Example/BDD, and has used it to transform three different organizations. He has trained more than 300 Business Analysts, Developers, and Testers in the correct use of SBE, including using it to deliver automated tests while the developers are still writing the code.
