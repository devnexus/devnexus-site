bio: "Danica began her career as a software engineer in data visualization and warehousing
  with a business intelligence team where she served as a point-person for standards
  and best practices in data visualization across her company. In 2018, Danica moved
  to San Francisco and pivoted to backend engineering with a derivatives data team
  which was responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure that processes
  millions of financial market data per second in near real-time. Her first project
  on this team involved Kafka Streams and Kafka Connect. From there, she immersed
  herself in the world of data streaming and found herself quite at home in the Apache
  Kafka and Apache Flink communities. She now leads the open source advocacy efforts
  at Snowflake, supporting Apache Iceberg and Apache Polaris (incubating).\r\n\r\nOutside
  of work, Danica is passionate about sustainability, increasing diversity in the
  technical community, and keeping her many houseplants alive. She can be found on
  X (Bluesky and Mastodon), talking about tech, plants, and baking @TheDanicaFine."
