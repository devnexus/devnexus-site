bio: "An engineer at heart and a leader by practice, I bring 17 years of experience
  in building robust enterprise solutions. As an Application Development Leader at
  BlackRock, I focus on designing and delivering scalable systems that drive real
  business impact. Java has always been my strongest language, and Iâ€™m equally passionate
  about exploring new and emerging technologies, especially the world of AI.\r\n\r\nBeyond
  my role, I nurture my passion for community building by leading the Java SIG at
  Atlanta BlackRock, where I connect developers, ideas, and innovation. Prior to BlackRock,
  I worked as a consultant with GAP, Pearson, JP Morgan, and SiriusXM, and I began
  my career as a full-stack developer, giving me a holistic view across the technology
  stack.\r\n\r\nI believe technology is as much about people as it is about code.
  As a mother, wife, and lifelong learner, I draw inspiration from music, travel,
  and dance, blending creativity into everything I do."
