bio: "I'm here to help you use Oracle Database better, and more easily.\r\n\r\nAs
  a Developer Evangelist at Oracle, I help developers build modern apps, including
  microservices, event-driven systems, cloud-native architectures, and more. If you're
  working with tools like Kubernetes, Spring Boot, or Kafka, and wondering how Oracle
  fits into that world, that's where I come in.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to share practical,
  hands-on guidance that helps you build faster, ship smarter, and make the most of
  Oracle's database tech. If you're using JSON, event streaming, vector search, or
  just figuring out how to get started, I'm here to make things clearer and more developer-friendly.\r\n\r\nLet's
  build something cool together."
