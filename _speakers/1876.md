Erin Schnabel (@ebullientworks) is a Java Champion, developer, advocate, and maker of things at Red Hat. She has 20 years under her belt, as a developer, technical leader, architect and evangelist, and she strongly prefers being up to her elbows in code. Erin learns (and teaches) by coding ridiculous things, like "Monster Combat", an application that makes monsters fight each other to explore application metrics; “Game On!” (https://gameontext.org), a text adventure game for microservices; and a reactive workshop (https://github.com/IBM/reactive-code-workshop) that munges "The Jabberwocky" to gain an understanding of how reactive operators work.
