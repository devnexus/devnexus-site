bio: "A 29 year java veteran. I wrote my first java program in java 1.0 when AWT on
  the mac and unix were different.\r\nSince that time I have written uncounted lines
  of java code, and rewritten most of them.\r\nWhen I first read Fowlers Refactoring
  my life changed for the better as I realized there was a safe way to fix code that
  no longer suited.\r\n"
