bio: "Sandeep Adi is a Senior Director of Engineering at ADP, where he has the privilege
  of leading the engineering teams behind the HR and Payroll technology roadmap for
  WorkforceNow, ADP's flagship HCM platform serving millions of users globally. With
  over 20 years of software industry experience, Sandeep continues to explore how
  the principles that create championship sports teams (collaboration, trust, and
  shared accountability) might serve as behavioral foundations for transforming engineering
  teams.\r\n\r\nAt ADP, Sandeep works alongside talented developers to advance innersourcing
  initiatives and founded the ADP Software Crafters meetup to foster shared learning
  across the organization. His approach to engineering leadership is deeply influenced
  by his lifelong passion for cricket, where he has observed how small behavioral
  changes in team dynamics can create meaningful performance improvements. He is constantly
  learning how to apply these insights to help software teams achieve sustainable
  results together.\r\n\r\nThrough both successes and failures in team building, Sandeep
  has discovered that the most impactful leadership often comes from asking better
  questions rather than having all the answers. When not building software or supporting
  teams, Sandeep can be found pursuing his love of Carnatic flute music, a practice
  that keeps him grounded in the discipline of continuous learning."
