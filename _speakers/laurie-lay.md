bio: "Laurie is a senior software engineer at Ippon Technologies, where she specializes
  in front-end development and software solutions that drive both user engagement
  and business success. With a master's degree in cognitive psychology, Laurie brings
  a unique perspective to software engineering, combining her understanding of human
  behavior with cutting-edge technology to create intuitive, user-friendly, and developer
  approved software applications.\r\n\r\nHer diverse career path spans a variety of
  fields, including professorship, owning a restaurant, motorcycle mechanics, and
  software engineering, each of which has contributed to her well-rounded skill set
  and innovative approach to problem-solving. This eclectic experience allows her
  to bridge the gap between technical complexity and real-world application, ensuring
  that the software she develops is both practical and accessible.\r\n\r\nIn the software
  development world, Laurie is particularly passionate about the impact of emerging
  technologies and their potential to accelerate development cycles and improve productivity.
  She is an advocate for learning, both for herself and others, and enjoys helping
  her colleagues discover their own learning paths and growth opportunities.  She
  is dedicated to mentoring and fostering a collaborative, inclusive learning environment
  within her teams. She believes in the power of shared knowledge and the importance
  of cultivating a growth mindset in any field, from software development to personal
  development. Outside of her technical role, Laurie is known for organizing internal
  workshops, knowledge-sharing sessions, and supporting new talent as they navigate
  their careers in tech.\r\n\r\nWhen she's not coding or mentoring, Laurie enjoys
  time spent outdoors, taking hikes with her dog in the mountains or at the ocean,
  and generally running around anywhere without a leash—metaphorically and literally.
  Her adventurous spirit is matched only by her dedication to continuous learning
  and improvement, both personally and professionally."
