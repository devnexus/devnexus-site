bio: Exploring new languages, frameworks, and technologies, and then sharing what
  he’s learned, has always come naturally to Ryan. Even when it wasn't his day job,
  Ryan has always been driven by his passion, spending his time and energy educating
  his friends, colleagues, or anyone else that would listen. Currently, Ryan is working
  as a software engineer as part of the Spring Cloud team.  Ryan has a passion for
  sharing what he learns via social media, including Twitter and his blog (http://ryanjbaxter.com),
  as well as in person at conferences.  When he’s not coding, Ryan likes spending
  time with his daughter, ice fishing, running obstacle course races, and watching
  the Red Sox.
