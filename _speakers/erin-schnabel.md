bio: Erin Schnabel (@ebullientworks) is a Distinguished Engineer and maker of things
  at Red Hat. She is a Java Champion, with over 25 years under her belt as a developer,
  technical leader, architect and advocate, and she strongly prefers being up to her
  elbows in code. Erin learns (and teaches) by coding ridiculous things, like "Monster
  Combat" (https://github.com/ebullient/monster-combat), an application that makes
  monsters fight each other to explore application metrics; and “Game On! Text Adventure”
  (https://gameontext.org) for exploring cloud native development.
