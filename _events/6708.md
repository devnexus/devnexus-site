As companies grow in size, achieving true agility becomes more and more challenging. Adding OKRs on top of that can create even more friction. But can OKRs really help your organisation be agile? In large technology organisations, friction is created when trying to implement and track OKRs. This happens because OKRs are perceived as a waterfall-like way of presenting business value to the teams and traditionally companies have been using activity-based OKRs. We will explore how agile can scale, by adopting value-based OKRs, while still leaving space to the teams to self-organize and plan their work. Examples will be given from both Scrum and large scale agile like SAFe.
