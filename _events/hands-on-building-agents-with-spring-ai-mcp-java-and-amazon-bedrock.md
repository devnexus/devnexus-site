title: 'Hands-On: Building Agents with Spring AI, MCP, Java, and Amazon Bedrock'
description: In this hands-on workshop you will learn how to build & deploy production-ready
  AI Agents.  You will use Spring AI, MCP, Java, and Amazon Bedrock and learn how
  to deal with production concerns like observability and security. We will start
  with basic prompting then expand with chat memory, RAG, and integration through
  MCP. In the end we will have a multi-agent system where agents interact with other
  agents to accomplish high-level tasks.
