title: 'Modular Monoliths: A happy middle'
description: "Monoliths get a bad rep. Experienced software developers have seen one
  too many monoliths devolve into a big ball of mud, leaving everyone frustrated,
  with an itch to do a \"rewrite\". But monoliths have their pros! They are usually
  simpler, easier to understand, and faster to build and debug. \r\n\r\nOn the other
  side of the spectrum you have microservices—that offer scale, both technically and
  organizationally, as well as having the badge of honor of being \"the new cool kid
  on the block\". But productionizing microservies is HARD. \r\n\r\nWhy can't we have
  our cake and eat it too? Turns out, we can. In this session we will explore the
  modular monolith—all the upsides of a monolith with none of the downsides of distributed
  architectures. We'll see what it means to build a modular monolith, and how that
  differs from a traditional layered architecture. We will discuss how we can build
  architectural governance to ensure our modules remain decoupled. Finally we'll see
  how our modules can communicate with one another without violating modularity. \r\n\r\nBy
  the end of this session you'll walk away with a greater appreciation for the monolith,
  and see how you can leverage this within your system architecture. "
