title: 'The Modern Spring Workflow: Enterprise-Ready Delivery and AI-Boosted Coding
  with Tanzu'
description: "Getting Spring applications to production—and keeping them there—requires
  more than great code. Security,\r\ncompliance, upgrades, and performance all shape
  the path from idea to enterprise-ready delivery. This session\r\nshows how VMware
  Tanzu streamlines that entire workflow. See how Application Advisor automates Spring
  Boot\r\nupgrades while integrating cleanly with AI coding assistants, how the Tanzu
  GenAI Service provides safe, selfservice access to approved LLMs, and how Tanzu
  Spring Extensions enforce consistent guardrails across\r\nteams. Finally, learn
  how the Tanzu Java Buildpack optimizes every Spring app for faster startup and lower\r\nmemory
  use. If you want to deliver modern Spring applications with more speed, confidence,
  and operational\r\nreadiness, this session provides the blueprint."
