title: 'ML Ops for Java Developers: A Hands-On Guide with Kubeflow and Quarkus'
description: "Machine learning is becoming a must-have skill in today's world. But
  do Java developers know how an ML Ops platform works under the hood? Do they know
  the best practices for integrating ML models into their Java applications?\r\nThis
  session is your go-to guide for understanding how ML Ops works and the best practices
  for consuming it within the Java ecosystem. We'll explore how Kubeflow, a powerful
  ML platform, simplifies the entire machine learning lifecycle—from model training
  to serving at scale. You’ll also discover how Quarkus, the Kubernetes-native Java
  framework, can efficiently deploy these models, making them easy to consume within
  your Java applications.\r\nDon’t miss this chance to elevate your Java skills and
  dive into the future of ML Ops. Join us and learn how to integrate machine learning
  into your Java projects with Kubeflow and Quarkus. Your journey to becoming a Java
  ML Ops expert starts here! \r\n"
