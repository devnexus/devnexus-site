  Automation'
description: "Unlock the performance and cost savings of modern Java without the massive
  manual effort. Many companies are hindered by the overwhelming complexity of modernization
  due to the variety of legacy enterprise Java applications they still need to maintain.\r\nDiscover
  how modern approaches provide powerful automated solutions. In this talk, we'll
  deconstruct a real-life success story: modernizing a legacy monolith to a modern
  runtime and Java 21. Learn how to automatically transform your codebase, mitigate
  the risks of manual error, and accelerate your path to the cloud. See practical
  steps you can use to breathe new life into your applications and free your teams
  to build for the future. If time permits, AI may make an appearance too!."
