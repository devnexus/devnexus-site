title: Java and the Internet of Things
description: "Java is the powerhouse of enterprise app development, but it's also
  a player in the world of connected devices. Today's active projects include deep
  sea fleet management, healthcare interoperability, environmental management, smart
  home devices, and more.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we present a brief survey of the
  role of Java in IoT applications. Then, we demonstrate the principles of IoT development
  with live coding and physical devices. (Yes, we have props!) If the Internet behaves
  itself, we show you how devices use the cloud to communicate with one another."
