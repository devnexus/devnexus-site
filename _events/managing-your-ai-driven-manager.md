title: Managing Your AI-Driven Manager
description: The threat to your job isn’t that an AI can replace you — it’s that a
  manager will think AI can replace you. This talk covers how to build a relationship
  with your manager that makes you their primary technical ally. The idea is to become
  the person they trust to evaluate both the benefits — and the costs — of using AI
  tools, showing where they can help and where you really need to be careful using
  them. In a rapidly changing world, you can become the person your manager relies
  on to give them good advice, all while you get to enjoy playing with the latest
  toys.
