title: Mastering Logging in Java
description: "Logging isn’t just about debugging; it’s how you figure out what your
  application was thinking before it all went wrong.  It is important for understanding
  why your application isn't working properly.  This session will compare popular
  Java logging frameworks like Java Util Logging, Log4J, SLF4J, and Logback, highlighting
  their strengths and quirks.\r\n\r\nWe’ll also look at the shiny new Log4j 3 and
  how it stacks up against its predecessor, Log4j 2. Whether you’re trying to improve
  your logging game or just want fewer “what the heck happened?” moments, this talk
  should be helpful for you."
