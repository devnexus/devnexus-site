Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building highly scalable microservices connected to shared messaging systems.
Together with Spring Cloud Function, Spring Cloud Task and other frameworks from the Spring Cloud portfolio, it is evolving and quickly becoming a go-to solution for users who want to spend more time concentrating on functional aspects of their microservices while guarding themselves from nonfunctional (boilerplate) concerns such as connectivity, integration, and many others.
In this "state of the union" session (50/50 presentation/live-code), Oleg and Glenn will discuss and demonstrate the current features, the recent changes and enhancements, and talk about what's coming in the future.
