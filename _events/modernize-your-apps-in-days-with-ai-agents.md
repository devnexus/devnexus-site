title: Modernize your apps in days with AI Agents
description: "Still wrangling legacy code and applications? In this lab, you will
  learn how to analyze, upgrade, and migrate your Java apps to the cloud with autonomous
  AI agents in GitHub Copilot, drastically simplify your modernization effort, unlock
  the full power of the cloud with confidence, and stay in complete control during
  each step.\r\n\r\nYou will begin by assessing the application's current state, then
  upgrade its runtime and frameworks, migrate its components to Azure services, containerize
  it, and finally deploy the modernized application to Azure. This end-to-end workflow
  demonstrates how AI agents can accelerate the application modernization journey
  from months to days."
