title: Debugging with IntelliJ IDEA
description: "Historically, debuggers are used to help locate and fix bugs. Nowadays,
  the debugger in IntelliJ IDEA can help you do much more than that. Let's see how
  the debugger helps make the development process more productive. I demo various
  features for debugging Java applications, including not-so-standard ones, like:\r\n\r\n*
  Lambda breakpoints\r\n* Stream chain tracing\r\n* Dropping the frame\r\n* Emulated
  method breakpoint\r\n* Evaluate and log\r\n* Non-suspending breakpoints \r\n* Custom
  data renderers and more\r\n\r\n100% live coding session"
