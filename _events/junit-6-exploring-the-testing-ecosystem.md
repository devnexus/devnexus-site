title: JUnit 6 + exploring the testing ecosystem
description: We'll start out by looking at what is new in JUnit 6. However, there's
  more to testing than just JUnit so you’ll also learn how to use other libraries
  like Hamcrest, AssertJ, JUnit Pioneer, Selenium. You’ll also see a comparison of
  the most common mocking libraries. After some tips for using your IDE to help you
  with testing, you’ll learn about some common testing patterns.
