title: Complex Problems... and other ways to disappoint your friends.
description: "Most developers have heard of \"Big O notation\" but it stops there.
  \ One step further is a cliff.  If you don't know it's there, welp, it was nice
  knowing ya.  *Pirate accent* THAR BE SEA DRAGONS *end dramatic accent*\r\n\r\nIt's
  hard to make computer science interesting, or even relevant, but in this talk I
  focus on the key aspects that you can't ignore.  It's important to know when you
  stumble across an NP-Complete problem, and what you can do.  I promise short journey
  into the jungle of PSPACE for developers who have never even heard these terms.\r\n"
