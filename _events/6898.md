We know that microservices are good right? (Like Superman), but what if I told you is not a clear-cut of good vs evil, and is more like Batman (with his morally questionable stances)? In this session we dive deep into the hidden (like Uptime percentage, Complecting), and not-so-hidden (Managing Complexity, Network Wire Performance) tradeoffs every time we create a new Microservice. We explores the lessons we learned at Expedia when we combined five microservices into one, and shaved-off 12 seconds of lost latency.
