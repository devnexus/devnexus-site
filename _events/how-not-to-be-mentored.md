title: How Not To Be Mentored
description: "How to does one get the best out of a mentor-ship,  while providing
  value to both the mentee and the mentor in times of time spent and growth? \r\n\r\nThe
  mentee/mentor relationship in tech tends to be wrought with issues if not structured
  properly on both ends. This talk hopes to provide actionable steps learned from
  my wins and losses based on my experience being a part of a learn-to-code mentorship
  group for 1 year period. This talk will include : \r\n=> Understanding the value
  propositions of the participants [mentee vs mentor]), etc.\r\n=> Setting relationship
  fundamentals/foundations and expectations/results.\r\n=> Time and task management
  suggestions.\r\n=> How to deal with challenges as they come up. \r\n=> Content to
  read ( books, articles, and people to follow on Twitter).\r\n=> Etc ( Anything else
  that can come to mind when writing this talk based on the theme of the audience/
  conference ). "
