title: The Problems Micro Frontends Won't Solve That No One Wants to Talk About
description: "Everyone wants to ship more software faster, and following the lead
  of the MicroServices craze the frontend community has begun to reach for Micro Frontends
  as a silver bullet solution. Micro Frontends promise large teams the ability to
  independently ship pieces of applications without code collisions, bug creation,
  that can be team-agnostic, and with Webpack, Vercel, NX, and others leaning in to
  offer ways to federate code, this seems to be the way of the future.\r\n\r\nBut
  what problems aren't solved by Micro Frontends? There is a large gap in what large
  complex teams need to ship better software and what Micro Frontends are able to
  provide ... and that gap is the basis of this talk. We'll discuss the consequences
  that arise when attempting to implement MFE architecture that no on seems to want
  to talk about."
