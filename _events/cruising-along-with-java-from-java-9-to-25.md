title: 'Cruising Along with Java: From Java 9 to 25'
description: "Java has been evolving at a fast but steady pace, with six months releases.
  Much has changed in the language, bringing conciseness, elegance, and above all
  better modeling facilities to design software. In this hands-on workshop come experience
  first hand the facilities offered by modern Java and learn how we can benefit from
  it on our software projects. In addition to exploring the newer syntax, we will
  peek into the semantics and the bytecode to understand the behavior of the code,
  its effect on performance and interoperability to other languages on the JVM.\r\n\r\nEach
  attendee will receive a copy of the book on the topic written by the presenter.\r\nWorkshop
  Requirements:\r\nPlease have these installed on your system well ahead of the workshop:\r\n*
  git client\r\n* your favorite IDE (IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition recommended but
  not required)\r\n* Latest version of the JDK\r\n\r\nWorkshop Learnings:\r\n* Why
  should you modernize your Java applications?\r\n* What are some of the new design
  capabilities you can leverage\r\n* How to make code fluent and less error prone\r\n*
  Learn how to intermix multiple features for greater benefits\r\n* Know the dos and
  don'ts with modern Java\r\n\r\nWorkshop Benefits:\r\n* Get the motivation and knowledge
  you need to modernize your Java applications\r\n* Know the power and the performance
  implications of newer features\r\n* Knowing the details, device a plan to modernize
  your codebase\r\n* Get a glimpse of where Java is heading\r\n* Influence how Java
  is applied in your enterprise\r\n\r\nWorkshop Who Should Attend:\r\n*Programmers\r\n*Team
  leads\r\n*Hands-on Architects\r\n*Technical Managers\r\nwho are involved in applications
