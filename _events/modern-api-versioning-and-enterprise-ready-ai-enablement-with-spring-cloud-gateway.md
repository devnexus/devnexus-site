title: Modern API Versioning and Enterprise-Ready AI enablement with Spring Cloud
  Gateway
description: "Spring Cloud Gateway now adds first-class support for API versioning
  to help teams evolve services safely and\r\npredictably. The addition of API versioning
  support to Spring Cloud Gateway allows for enhanced version\r\nnegotiation, enhanced
  route matching, better backwards compatibility and improved deprecation workflows.
  By\r\ngenerating, standards-compliant OpenAPI specifications from domain-centric
  models and action-oriented API\r\nendpoint designs, we’ll discuss how shifting toward
  action-based definitions produces clearer intent, improves\r\ncross-team API discoverability,
  and enables richer tooling support, including compatibility with Model Context\r\nProtocol–based
  client tools. By aligning gateway-defined routes and versioning metadata with well-structured\r\nOpenAPI
  documents, teams can automate client generation, enforce consistency, and improve
  their use with AI\r\nenabled intelligent applications and tools. Thus providing
  a stable base that lets teams advance their applications\r\ninto new opportunities.
  In this session, we’ll walk through practical patterns for header-based, URI-based,
  and\r\nmedia-type versioning, and show how these strategies integrate seamlessly
  with the new Spring Boot 4\r\napplication model. Attendees will leave with clear
  guidance on designing developer-friendly, scalable API\r\nversioning strategies
  that align with modern microservice and edge-service architectures."
