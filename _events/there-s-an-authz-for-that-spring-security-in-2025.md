title: 'There''s an Authz for that: Spring Security in 2025'
description: "Alongside authentication, Spring Security simplifies your authorization,
  too, specifically helping decouple your authorization and application logic. These
  days, standards like OpenFGA and OAuth are changing the landscape of authorization
  like never before.\r\n\r\nSpring Security is ready to anticipate those changes with
  you.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll take an existing Spring Boot application and add
  authorization to its requests, methods, domain objects, and queries. You’ll learn
  about the many authorization advancements Spring Security has made since you last
  blinked. By the end, you’ll see how these features are brought to bear on the everyday
  challenges of local and remote authorization, coarse- and fine-grained authorization,
  and authorized domain objects.\r\n \r\nNo previous authorization or Spring Security
  experience is required."
