title: 'Back to the Future of Software: How to Survive the AI Apocalypse with Tests,
  Prompts, and Specs'
description: "Great Scott! The robots are coming for your job—and this time, they
  brought unit tests. Join Doc and Marty from the Software Future (Baruch and Leonid)
  as they race back in time to help you fight the machines using only your domain
  expertise, a well-structured prompt, and a pinch of Gherkin. This keynote is your
  survival guide for the AI age: how to close the intent-to-prompt chasm before it
  swallows your roadmap, how to weaponize the Intent Integrity Chain to steer AI output
  safely, and why the Art of the Possible is your most powerful resistance tool. Expect:\r\n-
  Bad puns\r\n- Good tests\r\n- Wild demos\r\n\r\nThe machines may be fast. But with
  structure, constraint, and a little time travel, you’ll still be the one writing
  the future."
