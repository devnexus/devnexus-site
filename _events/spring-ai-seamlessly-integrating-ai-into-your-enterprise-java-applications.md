title: 'Spring AI: Seamlessly Integrating AI into Your Enterprise Java Applications'
description: "As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly important in enterprise
  software development, Java developers need practical ways to integrate AI capabilities
  into their applications. Spring AI provides a familiar and pragmatic approach to
  this challenge, allowing developers to incorporate AI features while leveraging
  the established patterns and practices of the Spring ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis session
  demonstrates Spring AI's portable APIs that enable developers to switch seamlessly
  between different AI models and vector stores. We'll show how this abstraction layer
  allows you to write code once and run it with providers like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI,
  or local models, as well as vector stores such as Postgres, Chroma, or Weaviate.\r\n\r\nThrough
  live coding demonstrations, we'll showcase:\r\n* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
  implementation using vector databases for intelligent document processing\r\n* Function
  Calling patterns that enable AI models to interact with your business logic\r\n*
  Evaluation techniques to measure LLM response accuracy and mitigate hallucination\r\n*
  Observability features to monitor your AI application's behavior in production\r\n"
