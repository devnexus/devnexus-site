title: 'AI Agents for Java Devs: From Demo to Deployment'
description: AI agents go beyond simple prompts — they reason, plan, and act. In this
  session, you’ll learn how to build AI-powered agents in Java using open source frameworks
  like LangChain4j. We’ll walk through real-world examples — from DevOps automation
  to customer support triage — showing what works in production and what pitfalls
  to avoid. You’ll leave with a practical understanding of agent orchestration patterns,
  evaluation methods, and deployment strategies for enterprise use cases.
