title: The Hidden Security Hazards in Your Java Stack
description: "Building Java apps feels smooth. You move fast, code freely, and ship
  often. But that same vibe coding mindset can open the door to serious security problems.
  Copying code from the internet or trusting your AI assistant too much can introduce
  unsafe logic. Adding libraries without checking them and running container images
  you did not build can silently expose your application to attacks.\r\n\r\nIn this
  session, you will see how modern Java stacks become vulnerable through real-world
  examples and live hacking. From untrusted dependencies to misconfigured containers,
  we will explore the common traps developers fall into. You will walk away with practical
  techniques to spot these risks early and keep your code secure in the cloud-native
  world."
