title: Testing Legacy Code & Refactoring Patterns
description: "Our jobs don't deal with new code, but old crufty and evil code. How
  do we test such code? How do we get through it? How can we surgically remove some
  of this harmful code and make it testable? How can we move away from excessive mocking?\r\n\r\nThis
  presentation looks at harmful code and discusses some strategies we can use to diagnose,
  test, apply, and finally refactor to produce something that promotes some sanity
  in your development process. The content of this course is all in Java and Junit.
  \ We discuss the following maneuvers:\r\n\r\n* Extract Delegate\r\n* Extract Interface\r\n*
  Parameterize Method\r\n* Parameterize Constructor\r\n* Sprout Method and Class\r\n*
  Wrap Method and Class\r\n"
