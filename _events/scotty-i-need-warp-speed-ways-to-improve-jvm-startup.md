title: Scotty I need Warp Speed - Ways to improve JVM startup
description: "When running Java in the cloud, the JVM startup time can become a limitation.
  Especially when you look at spinning up new instances of an app as response to changes
  in load, the warmup time can be a problem. A couple of years ago you only had CDS
  that could help you with the startup but meanwhile there are a couple of solutions
  that can help you to let you JVM start super fast. These days we have CRaC, Native
  Image, Leyden, InstantOn, Ready Now, JITServer and Cloud Native Compiler, which
  are all solutions that help to reduce the startup time of a JVM. Each of those is
  not a Silver Bullet, so you have to choose the right solution for your problem.\r\nThis
  session will give you a short overview of the different solutions to increase your
  JVM startup performance and will try to give you some hints on how to choose the
  right solution for your application."
