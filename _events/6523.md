DevOps is great, if you have the people, processes and tools to support it. In this session Iâ€™ll highlight the easiest ways for Java developers to work with their IT organizations and partners to deliver their code to the cloud, including the best ways to reliably make updates and maintain production cloud code. The focus is on real-world examples using Linux command line tools, open source tools including Jenkins, and other free SDKs and tools available on GitHub.
