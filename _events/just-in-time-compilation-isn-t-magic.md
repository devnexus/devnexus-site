title: Just-in-Time Compilation Isn't Magic
description: "Fortunately for most Java developers the just-in-time compiler just
  works and appears to work by magic. And yet sometimes, we find ourselves facing
  a performance problem, so what do we when the magic stops?\r\n\r\nIn this talk,
  we’ll learn a few key concepts behind the magic of modern optimizing compilers:
  intrinsics, basic blocks, static single assignment, and inlining. By learning these
  key concepts, you’ll learn to save time not trying to optimize the things that the
  compiler can already do for you and to focus on the things that matter most."
