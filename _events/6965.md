Spring Cloud Gateway is a developer-centric API gateway. An API gateway is an abstraction over a distributed systems architecture. The API Gateway is a natural place to provide cross-cutting concerns such as security, resiliency, and transformation. In this talk, we will discuss practical use cases that you may encounter. Some recipes we will discuss include: securing gateway with OAuth 2 and Spring Security and relaying tokens to services, rate-limiting using Spring Security and the logged-in user, implementing a backed-for-frontend using a scatter-gather technique and more.
