title: 'Patterns for Platform Engineering: Standardizing Java Delivery'
description: "In banking, the friction between developer velocity and regulatory compliance
  can stall modernization efforts.\r\nThis session outlines three architectural strategies
  that use platform engineering to reconcile these forces. It will\r\nlook at how
  to enforce application standards to ensure predictability, how to utilize standardized
  build\r\nmechanisms to automate governance and security auditing, and how to design
  applications that can withstand\r\nthe scale needed for daily banking activity.
  You'll get an idea of how to implement these strategies to reduce\r\ntechnical debt
  and ensure operational readiness in high-stakes environments"
