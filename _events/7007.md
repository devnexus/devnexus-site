Continuous refactoring is critical to succeeding in projects and is an important part of sustainable agile development.

In this workshop, we will start by discussing how to approach refactoring, the essential steps we need to take, and look into how to incrementally improve the internal design of code to make it extensible, maintainable, and cost-effective to change. In addition to discussing the concepts, we will take several code examples from real projects, discuss the code smells and explore the refactoring techniques. Along the way, we will also dive into refactoring short code samples and measure the quality of code before and after refactoring.
