title: 'OG Refactoring (Observing Gamma): Patterns to Refactor Towards'
description: "Erich Gamma, et al's Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented
  Software came out in 1994. Martin Fowlerâ€™s Refactoring: Improving the Design of
  Existing Code was first published in 1999. Joshua Kerievsky's Refactoring to Patterns
  in 2004. \r\n\r\nWhat have we learned since then about refactoring? What do we,
  as professional software developers, need to know before deciding to do a refactor
  on a legacy codebase? \r\n \r\nThe audience for this session are software developers
  and the people that interface with them (product owners, scrum masters, development
  managers) who need to know the value of this important and often neglected technical
  practice.\r\n \r\nAt the end of the session, the attendee will be able to identify
  hidden patterns in their code bases, plan a refactor effort on legacy codebases,
  write their own refactorings, and recognize accidental code complexity in large
  codebases.\r\n"
