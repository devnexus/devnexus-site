title: Streamlining Open Source Foundation Operations with Quarkus and GitHub Actions
description: Launching an open source foundation comes with challenges, from establishing
  governance processes to tracking memberships, maintaining communication, and building
  consensus across distributed teams.In this case study, I’ll show how we’ve used
  Quarkus and GitHub Actions to automate key operations, including asynchronous consensus
  building via reactions on GitHub discussions and pull requests, and simplifying
  data entry by distributing and synchronizing content across repositories with event
  hooks. Additionally, I’ll demonstrate how we’ve built a self-service portal for
  our members using a combination of Quarkus, the GitHub GraphQL and REST APIs, Lume
  (the static site generator for Deno), and Svelte.
