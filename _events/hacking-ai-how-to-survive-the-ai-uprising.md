title: Hacking AI - How to Survive the AI Uprising
description: "While AI can recognize faces under masks, track purchases, and watch
  you sleep, there's still hope when the Great Robot Revolution kicks off!  \r\n\r\nHacking
  software was cool in the 90s, but hacking data against AI will be cool tomorrow.
  We'll discuss some of the mechanics for data bias, image perturbation, and jailbreaking
  that are emerging as their own mechanics against machines. \r\n\r\nNo prior AI knowledge
  is needed for this talk, everyone will follow along and learn!"
