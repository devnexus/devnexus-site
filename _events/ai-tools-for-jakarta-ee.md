title: AI Tools for Jakarta EE
description: "Discover how AI-powered tools are reshaping Jakarta EE development by
  optimizing the entire development lifecycle.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, developers have
  relied on archetypes, project generators, and visual designers to kickstart projects.
  But what happens when we add an AI language model to the mix? The result is an intelligent
  project generator that scaffolds domain-relevant Jakarta EE applications with both
  backend and frontend functionalities ready to go.\r\n\r\nJoin me to witness how
  AI-powered tools are transforming enterprise application development through real-world,
  cutting-edge demonstrations. Discover how AI-powered tools enhance productivity
  and streamline workflows in Apache NetBeans IDE and beyond, from creating a simple
  hello-world program to developing full-stack applications."
