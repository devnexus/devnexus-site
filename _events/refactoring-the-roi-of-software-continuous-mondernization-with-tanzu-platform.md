title: 'Refactoring the ROI of Software: Continuous Mondernization with Tanzu Platform'
description: "Most production systems today are quietly running on unpatched, aging
  software, and businesses bet their\r\nreputation on it every single day. This session
  reframes that reality. I’ll share stories from the frontlines of helping\r\norganizations
  worldwide adopt continuous migration as a core engineering practice. We will walk
  through what\r\nsoftware looked like before continuous migration, the friction teams
  faced, and the key lessons learned in\r\nbuilding systems that stay maintainable
  without heroics or rewrite fantasies.You will see how continuous\r\nmigration with
  Application Advisor changes the ROI equation by enabling teams to refactor with
  confidence,\r\neliminate latent security risk, and future-proof their applications.
  We will highlight real teams that have turned\r\nmaintenance into a competitive
  advantage instead of a tax. To execute this shift at enterprise scale,\r\norganizations
  need more than tooling. They need visibility and strategy. We will look at how Tanzu
  Platform\r\nprovides full-stack insights into your app estate, surfaces legacy-stack
  risk, and gives teams a clear path to\r\nmodernize with platform-provided automation.
  The result is operational efficiency, application resiliency, and a\r\nmaterially
  stronger security posture."
