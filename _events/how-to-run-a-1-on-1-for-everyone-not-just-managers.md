title: How to run a 1 on 1 for Everyone (Not Just Managers!)
description: "Many of us have to go to 1 on 1 meetings on the regular, and they can
  be such a waste of time. Maybe there is no agenda. Maybe no one is taking notes.
  Or maybe your boss just keeps putting it off. These meetings can be frustrating
  and turn into a giant venting session with no real useful outcomes. \r\n\r\nBut
  that's not how it has to be. \r\n\r\nLet's talk through how you can run an effective,
  useful 1 on 1 meeting, even if you aren't in charge! We'll cover:\r\n\r\n- The purpose
  of a 1 on 1 meeting: Communication, Feedback, and Goals\r\n- How to structure the
  meeting and your notes\r\n- Things you can (and should) ask as a manager, an employee,
  or as a colleague."
