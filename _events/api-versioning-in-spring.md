title: API Versioning in Spring
description: 'Spring Framework 7 introduces a powerful API versioning feature to tackle
  the complexities of evolving HTTP APIs while ensuring backward compatibility. This
  talk will dive into the new Spring tools and annotations, such as the @ApiVersion
  annotation and enhanced RequestMapping capabilities. We will discuss multiple different
  versioning implementations, including: URI parameters, headers, and query parameters.
  Attendees will discover how to implement API versioning in Spring Boot applications.
  We will also see how the API versioning feature is used in Interface Clients, Spring
  Cloud Gateway and Spring Cloud Load Balancer.'
