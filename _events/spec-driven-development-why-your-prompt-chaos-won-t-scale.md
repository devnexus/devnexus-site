title: Spec Driven Development Why your prompt chaos won’t scale
description: "AI coding has come a long way, but relying on vibes, prompts, and prototypes
  quickly hits a wall. What starts as productive soon becomes unmanageable: fragile
  hacks, copy-pasted prompts, and inconsistent outputs that resist collaboration and
  refactoring.\r\n\r\nThis session introduces Spec Driven Development, a practical,
  scalable approach where AI coding is guided by human-readable specifications that
  capture intent, structure, and rules. You’ll see how moving beyond freestyle prompting
  enables better reuse, stronger tests-as-guardrails, and smoother transitions when
  frameworks or requirements change.\r\n\r\nWe’ll walk through real-world examples
  showing how specs can help keep code and AI aligned, even during ongoing iteration
  and team collaboration. \r\n\r\nIf you’ve ever felt like Copilot was helping you
  fly in circles, this talk offers a way to move forward, with direction.\r\n"
