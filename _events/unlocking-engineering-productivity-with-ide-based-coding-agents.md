title: Unlocking Engineering Productivity with IDE-Based Coding Agents
description: "Explore how coding agents, seamlessly integrated into your IDE, empower
  engineers to automate complex workflows and drive innovation at an unprecedented
  pace. This session will showcase practical use cases, including automated testing,
  effortless JDK upgrades, and terminal integration, emphasizing how these capabilities
  are natively supported within the development environment rather than relying on
  external tools.\r\nWe will delve into the lifecycle of a workflow, beginning with
  the expert who initiates the process. You'll learn how experts iterate to refine
  these workflows and determine whether they evolve into fully autonomous systems
  or remain human-driven. Additionally, we will discuss how sharing common workflows
  within teams and across organizations facilitates knowledge transfer, allowing domain
  experts to share their insights and scale themselves. This collaborative approach
  enables non-experts to perform expert-level tasks, fostering a culture of shared
  learning and innovation.\r\nDiscover how IDE-based automation helps maintain zero
  technical debt, streamlines repetitive tasks, and places powerful innovation directly
  in the hands of developers. Step into the future of enterprise Java productivity,
  where agentic workflows become an integral part of your daily coding experience."
