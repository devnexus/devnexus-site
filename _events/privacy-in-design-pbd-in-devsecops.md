title: Privacy in design (PbD) in DevSecOps
description: "Privacy by Design (PbD) in DevSecOps is a proactive approach that integrates
  privacy considerations into every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC),
  from initial design to deployment and operations. It ensures that privacy is not
  an afterthought, but a fundamental aspect of how systems and processes are built.\r\nBy
  systematically embedding privacy by design principles into DevSecOps, organizations
  can build more secure, compliant, and trustworthy applications and systems, ultimately
  benefiting both the business and its users.\r\nPrivacy by Design (PbD) is a fundamental
  approach to application security that ensures privacy is embedded into the design
  and architecture of IT systems, business practices, and networked infrastructure
  from the very beginning, rather than being an afterthought. It shifts the responsibility
  for data protection away from users and onto the organizations collecting, storing,
  and sharing the data.\r\n"
