title: Runtime Efficiencies and Spring Boot
description: "Spring Boot 3 introduces a suite of features designed to enhance runtime
  performance and optimize resource usage. In this talk, we’ll explore the key innovations
  in this release that help developers build faster, more efficient applications.
  We'll begin with Ahead-of-Time (AOT) processing, which accelerates startup times
  by precomputing application configurations, followed by Class Data Sharing (CDS),
  which reduces memory usage by allowing JVM processes to share class metadata.\r\n\r\nWe’ll
  dive into GraalVM native images, highlighting how they drastically improve startup
  performance and memory consumption, making them ideal for modern cloud-native applications.
  We’ll also cover Project CRAC (Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint), a game-changer
  for reducing startup times in containerized environments by allowing JVM applications
  to be suspended and restored with minimal overhead.\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll wrap up
  with the integration of Java 21's virtual threads, a revolutionary improvement in
  how Spring Boot handles high-concurrency tasks, greatly enhancing scalability and
  efficiency. Through live demos, you'll learn how to leverage these tools and techniques
  to optimize your Spring Boot applications for maximum runtime performance."
