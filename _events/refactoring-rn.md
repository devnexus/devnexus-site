title: Refactoring RN
description: "Github copilot came out in 2021 and Open Rewrite joined Commonhaus in
  2024. In this age of AI and other powerful tools why should a developer take the
  time to learn manual refactoring? Or even plan and execute their own novel refactorings?
  \r\n\r\nThis talk will delve into these questions with humor and the introduction
  of a novel refactoring. The new refactoring allows the developer to change the return
  type of a method without breaking the code even when the method is used many places.\r\n\r\nThe
  audience for this session are software developers and the people that interface
  with them (product owners, scrum masters, development managers) who need to know
  the value of this important and often neglected technical practice.\r\n \r\nAt the
  end of the session, the attendee will be able to identify hidden patterns in their
  code bases, plan a refactor effort on legacy codebases, write their own refactorings,
  and know when to use AI or other tools to perform the refactoring.\r\n"
