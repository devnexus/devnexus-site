title: 'Jakarta EE: Connected Industries with an Edge'
description: Manufacturing facilities, production lines, and industrial automation
  units have traditionally been disconnected from the internet. However, to stay competitive
  in the digital era, these systems must evolve into smart, interconnected networks
  by integrating key technologies such as digital twins and the Industrial Internet
  of Things (IIoT), which require internet connectivity and the cloud. As data volumes
  generated by industrial equipment are substantial, relying solely on cloud infrastructure
  becomes insufficient due to bandwidth limitations, latency issues, and the inability
  to handle real-time data processing effectively. Even more, it poses key security
  challenges. This is where edge computing becomes critical. Edge computing brings
  data processing closer to the source, reducing latency and bandwidth strain, enabling
  faster decision-making and seamless operations. This talk explores how industrial
  automation can safely and efficiently move online by leveraging Jakarta EE applications
  as edge computing units. The presentation will also highlights the features that
  application servers for Jakarta EE apps should offer to meet the demands of operational
  technologies and factory environments, such as security, reliability, scalability,
  and long-term support. The presentation showcase these opportunities through a demo
  build with Payara Platform.
