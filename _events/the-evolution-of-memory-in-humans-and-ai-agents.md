title: The Evolution of Memory in Humans and AI Agents
description: "Memory shapes how we think, learn, and create. Humans have built memory
  systems for thousands of years: from oral traditions to memory palaces. Today, AI
  agents also need memory to be useful and reliable. They need to recall past events,
  connect knowledge, retrieve information quickly, and even forget the right things.\r\n\r\nIn
  this talk, we will look at the history of human memory and see what lessons it offers
  for AI. We will explore different types of memory:\r\n\r\n- Episodic memory for
  storing events and experiences\r\n- Semantic memory for facts and knowledge\r\n-
  Working memory for short-term reasoning\r\n- Vector or embedding memory for fast
  retrieval across large contexts\r\n\r\nWe will then see how each of these can be
  implemented in AI agents, what challenges arise, and what trade-offs we need to
  consider. The goal is to give you both inspiration from human history and concrete
  tools for building better agents with memory."
