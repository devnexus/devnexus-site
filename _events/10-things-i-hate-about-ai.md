title: 10 Things I Hate About AI
description: "Everyone's talking about AI creating 10x engineers. Meanwhile, you're
  over here debugging hallucinated code at 2 AM, wondering if the AI is gaslighting
  you or if you've finally lost it.\r\n\r\nIf you've ever found yourself arguing with
  a chatbot or watching your productivity mysteriously plummet while your manager
  celebrates the \"AI transformation,\" this talk is your therapy session.\r\n\r\nWe're
  diving into the messy reality of AI adoption in software development. The stuff
  that doesn't make it into the case studies. We'll talk about the most common grievances
  that disrupt a developerâ€™s flow, from dealing with overly confident wrong answers
  to figuring out how to prompt for a useful solution.\r\n\r\nYou know that study
  showing developers take 19% longer to complete tasks with AI? Yeah, we'll talk about
  that too. Along with the productivity theater, the metrics that make no sense, and
  why \"seamless integration\" is apparently developer speak for \"good luck with
  that.\"\r\n\r\nWhether you're a developer drowning in AI mandates, a team lead trying
  to make sense of it all, or an engineering manager caught between executive enthusiasm
  and developer eye-rolls, come ready for validation, practical strategies, and maybe
  a few laughs about our collective journey into the AI-powered future."
