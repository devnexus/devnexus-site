title: 'The Responsible Java Developer: Trustworthy GenAI in Practice'
description: Enterprises can’t afford “move fast and break things” with AI. This session
  equips Java developers with practical patterns for responsible AI adoption. We’ll
  cover safe prompt design, output validation, logging for audits, and data protection
  strategies — all using open source GenAI tooling. Through code examples and case
  studies, you’ll see how to add AI features without introducing security, cost, or
  compliance risks. Build smarter apps — and build them safely.
