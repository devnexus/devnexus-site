title: Optimizing Containerized Java Apps with Jib, GraalVM, CDS, and CRaC
description: In today’s cloud-native world, keeping microservices reliable and scalable
  is essential. Java Java developers and architects often struggle to optimize containerized
  Java apps because configuring and integrating powerful tools into their build processes
  is complex. This session explores practical techniques to improve performance in
  cloud environments, including creating custom JREs, using Jib for easier container
  builds, and leveraging GraalVM for faster startup times. You’ll learn to use Class
  Data Sharing (CDS) and CRaC to improve startup times, while evaluating trade-offs
  to choose the best optimization techniques, ensuring your applications are optimized
  for scale, reliability, and efficiency in the cloud.
