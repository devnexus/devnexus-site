title: 'Modern Problems Require Modern Solutions: Finding Your Meme Twin with Embeddings
  & Vector Databases'
description: "Do you look like a famous meme character? Does someone you know? Knowing
  this information is vital—both for your career and your personal life. After all,
  am I the only one around here who wants to avoid [Angry Walter](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/am-i-the-only-one-around-here)?
  And who *wouldn't* want to work with  [Success Kid](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/success-kid-i-hate-sandcastles).\r\n\r\nBut
  can we even find out if we have a meme twin? There are lots of memes. And lots of
  people. How could we possibly search them all? Well, it's easier than you think
  if we turn those memes into embeddings and search them with a vector database!\r\n\r\nBut
  what's an embedding? And what's a vector database? Well, that's what I'll cover
  in this session. I'll begin by exploring embeddings, showing how unstructured data,
  such as text and images, can be translated into hyper-dimensional arrays—called
  vectors—using both common and custom AI models. Then I'll talk about vector databases,
  covering what they are and how you can use them to store and search those embeddings
  with embeddings of your own.\r\n\r\nOf course, we'll do this all by example. I've
  turned all the big memes—from [Ancient Aliens Guy](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ancient-aliens)
  to [Zombie Boy](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/184608242/zombie-boy)—into embeddings
  and have loaded them into a vector database. I've built an application around these
  embeddings and that database. I'll show you the code and the queries of this application
  so that you can build something similar for yourself. And, most importantly, we'll
  take some photos during the session and use it all to find your meme twin!\r\n\r\nSo,
  are you ready to find your meme twin? Or are you ready to learn how to use this
  technology? I say, [Why Not Both](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/why-not-both-why-dont-we-have-both)."
