title: 'TDD: Test-Driven Development vs TAB-Driven Development'
description: "The rise of AI-powered coding assistants is changing the way we approach
  code completion, often allowing us to accept suggestions with a simple press of
  the TAB key, significantly speeding up our workflow. These tools can even generate
  the necessary tests automatically. \r\nIn this context, is Test-Driven Development
  (TDD) becoming obsolete? Or does the practice of using tests to drive the design
  of our applications still hold substantial value in the age of AI? Let's explore
  the evolving landscape of software development and look at the ongoing relevance
  of TDD in an AI-enhanced world."
