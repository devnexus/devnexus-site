A typical development team spends 30% to 40% of its time fixing bugs; multiple examples at multiple companies demonstrate that Specification by Example/BDD can reduce that to 1% to 2%. If an average developer costs $150,000 per year (salary plus benefits), that is a savings of $50K per developer per year â€“ not to mention the value of delivering code faster with fewer bugs. How much of that do you want?
