title: Protect The Bat-Computer! Understanding OAuth2 (With The Help Of Some Super
  Friends)
description: "OAuth2 can be difficult to understand - this talk takes the mystery
  out of it. It begins by explaining OAuth2 using a couple of heroes with a problem
  (Batman has a Bat-Computer that Superman would like to use, but Batman doesn't know
  Superman. However, they both know Wonder Woman) and shows how the heroes interact
  to allow Superman access to the Bat-Computer. We then map the characters into their
  OAuth2 equivalents (the Bat-Computer is a shared resource, Batman is the resource
  owner, etc.) and see how the OAuth2 flow works.\r\n\r\nNext, we look at implementing
  OAuth2 in some common frameworks, such as Spring. Tips are offered for debugging
  OAuth2 and implementing it on the front end. The speaker will offer some advice
  gleaned from implementing OAuth2 security at multiple companies.\r\n\r\nParticipants
  will leave with an understanding of the OAuth2 workflow, some practical examples,
  and advice on implementing it in common situations."
