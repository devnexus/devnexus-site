While it seems that every week new terms appear to describe DevOps tools, segments, ideas, practices, etc., are they really new? CI/CD, Progressive Delivery, AIOps, GitOps, TreeOps (not real, but who knows, maybe it will be next week?) -  are they all the same, or are they just reimagining last week’s buzz words? In this talk we will break down a few of these terms, what they mean, how they’re used, and why they may matter for you and your teams.
