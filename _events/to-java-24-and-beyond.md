title: To Java 24 and Beyond!
description: "Java 21 has come and gone, but the Java release train continues with
  Java 24!\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will briefly review key changes between
  Java 11 and 21, as they form an important foundation for where Java is heading.
  Once that foundation is laid, we will look at what has changed in Java since 21,
  updates to Project Loom with a focus on, Scoped Values and Structured Concurrency,
  and how they will rewrite the Java concurrency story. \r\n\r\nWe will also cover
  other important changes including: Generational ZGC, the Foreign Function and Memory
  API, JavaDoc updates, and even take a look into the future of where Java is heading! "
