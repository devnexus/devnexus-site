title: Debugging Java
description: "When trying to track down a bug, the first thing we usually do is jump
  into the debugger and start stepping through the code. Then we settle in for a long,
  tedious slog stepping through the code. This session will discuss how bugs are caused,
  and some great techniques and tools you can use to streamline your debugging sessions.\r\n\r\nWe
  will be referencing the book \"Why Programs Fail\" by Andreas Zeller and the new
  book “Troublshooting Java” by Laurențiu Spilcă."
