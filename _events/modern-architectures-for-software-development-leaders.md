title: Modern Architectures for Software Development Leaders
description: "Should we build Microservices, SOA, Monoliths, Modular Monoliths, Event
  Driven Architecture, and the list goes on. We hear so much from the developers and,
  at times it feels like they want to build them all.\r\n\r\nAs a leader, your focus
  is not on building stuff but delivering value to your business and customers. From
  that point of view, it is highly critical to understand why we should choose a particular
  architecture and when to facilitate your team to build one or more of a particular
  architecture.\r\n\r\nThis session will get directly to those questions, and help
  you to develop a clear understanding of why and when to use one architectural pattern
  over another and when to intermix them."
