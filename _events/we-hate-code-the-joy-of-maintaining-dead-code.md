title: We hate code - The !joy of maintaining dead code
description: "Disclaimer: If you love to maintain legacy code than this session is
  not for you. \r\nYou probably know the hassle of maintaining code that was written
  long time before you entered the project or company. Often the developers who wrote
  it are not even in the company anymore. So how do you know if the code is still
  used? Often you simply don’t  know and so you take the code with you…from one release
  to another…and the codebase is growing.\r\nThis session will give you an idea about
  what you can do to get rid of legacy code. Which tools are available and how they
  can help you to male your life easier."
