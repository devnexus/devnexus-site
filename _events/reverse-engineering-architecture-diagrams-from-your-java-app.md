title: Reverse-engineering architecture diagrams from your Java app
description: "You've adopted the C4 model and have a collection of zoomable system
  context and container diagrams. These are useful for having high-level conversations,
  but they don't cover the internal implementation details of your Java app. You consider
  creating a C4 component diagram. Unfortunately the size and complexity of your Java
  codebase makes manually drawing this out of the question, and reverse-engineering
  the codebase with a generic tool produces a cluttered diagram that literally shows
  everything. How do you create useful component level diagrams that remain up to
  date with minimal effort? Is this even possible?\r\n\r\nJoin me for a discussion
  of how to tackle this problem, where I'll cover the theory and tactics behind how
  to reverse-engineer meaningful component diagrams, before presenting a live demo
  of how to use the open source Structurizr DSL to put the techniques into action."
