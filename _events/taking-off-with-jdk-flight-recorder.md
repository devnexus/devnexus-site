title: Taking off With JDK Flight Recorder
description: Are you running into problems with Java applications in production? Not
  understanding what is eating up all your system resources? And throwing a bunch
  of System.out messages in your code is not helping? You should check out the JDK
  Flight Recorder (JFR). JFR is a powerful and low-overhead observability tool built
  into the JVM that can help you track down those performance issues and difficult-to-understand
  bugs. In this presentation, we will go through the basics of using JFR in your Java
  applications.
