Is Observability really just logging, metrics, and distributed tracing? Are we done? Mission accomplished? Can we go home for the week even if it is just Tuesday?
You can often hear about the "Three Pillars of Observability" but having access to logs, metrics, and traces does not necessarily mean more observable systems. In this forward-looking presentation, you'll learn what Observability is, what problems the three pillars solve, what problems they generate, and how deep the rabbit hole goes behind them.
