title: Long Live Short Lived Credentials - Auto-rotating Secrets At Scale
description: "By now, you are very likely aware of the problem of secrets sprawl.
  Millions of hardcoded plaintext credentials keep showing up online in easy-to-scan
  places year after year. Worse yet, adversaries have gotten very good at exfiltrating
  and validating these secrets.  Rotating the key or password after an attack is far
  too late. \r\n\r\nWhat if every credential that an adversary could find expired
  before they could exploit it? What if keys, just a few hours old, no longer worked?
  \r\n\r\nLet's embrace a future of proper secrets management and auto-rotating secrets.
  It might seem overwhelming at first to consider accomplishing this, especially if
  you have never tackled secrets management before, but for many systems, this is
  easier to achieve than you might realize.\r\n\r\nIn this session, you will \r\n-
  Get an update on the state of secrets sprawl\r\n- Diagram auto-rotation architectures\r\n-
  Plan a secrets audit and code refactor strategy\r\n- Start the email that will help
  you convince the team\r\n"
