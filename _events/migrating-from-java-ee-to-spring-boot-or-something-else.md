title: Migrating from Java EE - to Spring Boot or something else?
description: "Many companies use old and expensive Java EE servers like WebSphere
  or WebLogic. If you're considering moving away from them, this session is for you.
  We'll explore three options: the widely used Spring Boot framework, modern open-source
  Jakarta EE servers like GlassFish, and emerging choices like Quarkus and Piranha
  Cloud.\r\n\r\nThrough live demos and discussions, we'll compare these options in
  terms of how easy it is to get started, how straightforward it is to migrate from
  Java EE, how developer-friendly they are, and what features they offer for production.
  We'll also look at the evolution of the Jakarta EE ecosystem and how it currently
  compares to SpringBoot.\r\n\r\nWhether you're a developer, a DevOps engineer, or
  an architect, this session will give you practical insights and help you make informed
  choices about your Java stack. Join me in finding out the answer to the question:
  Should you migrate from Java EE to Spring Boot or something else?\r\n"
