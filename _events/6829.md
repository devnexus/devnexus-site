One of the key benefits of a microservice architecture is the ability to dynamically respond to changes in load by spinning up new instances as required. However, when deploying JVM-based services, the warmup time of JIT compilation can be a limitation on the effectiveness of this technique.

One approach to solving this problem is using native images, where the service is statically compiled using an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler.  Although this does reduce startup time and footprint, it does so at the cost of overall performance.

A new project has been proposed and accepted into OpenJDK called CRaC (Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint).  The goal is to research the co-ordination of Java programs with mechanisms to checkpoint (snapshot) a running application.  Restoring from the snapshot could solve some of the problems with the startup and warmup times, especially in microservices.

In this session, weâ€™ll look at the main challenges for such a project, potential solutions and the results from a proof-of-concept implementation.
