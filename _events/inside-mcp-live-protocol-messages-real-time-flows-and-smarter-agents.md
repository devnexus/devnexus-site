title: 'Inside MCP: Live Protocol Messages, Real-Time Flows, and Smarter Agents'
description: "You’ve heard the buzz — now roll up your sleeves and build with it.
  In this hands-on workshop, you’ll learn exactly how the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
  works — and you’ll write your own MCP server tool from scratch, then author an Agent
  that uses it to deliver real-time, context-aware help right inside your dev flow.\r\n\r\nWe’ll
  break down the raw MCP protocol step by step:\r\n\t•\tHow it streams context between
  your IDE and Agents\r\n\t•\tHow messages are structured and exchanged\r\n\t•\tHow
  to wire up an MCP Client to talk to your new tool\r\n\r\nBy the end, you’ll not
  only understand the protocol — you’ll have built a working MCP server tool and your
  own Agent that plugs into it to automate tasks, provide better suggestions, and
  boost your productivity.\r\n\r\nBring your curiosity — and your laptop — because
  you’ll walk away with practical code, a working prototype, and the confidence to
  build and extend your own MCP-powered tools and Agents."
