title: Software Supply Chain Security with Policy as Code
description: "How do you ensure that your Java software supply chain is secure? How
  do you reliably repeat and automate governance and compliance of your Java applications?\r\n\r\nPolicy
  as Code (PaC) enables orgs to apply automated controls across multiple policy enforcement
  points and artifact types. This talk will explore how OSS PaC can be used to validate
  software supply chain artifacts, focusing on Java ecosystem artifacts. \r\n\r\nThis
  talk will cover PaC concepts, and how to use PaC to detect and prevent unwanted
  behaviors. PaC concepts learned in this talk will work at the developer desktop
  as well as in continuous integration automation, thereby improving governance and
  compliance of the Java software supply chain."
