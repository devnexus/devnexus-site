title: Testing Your Way to Production Confidence with Native Images
description: "For Spring developers, GraalVM native images offer exciting potential:
  smaller footprint, faster startup, and improved performance. However, confidently
  deploying these images requires verifying they produce the same results as your
  JVM-based application. This talk shares a practical pattern for testing Spring Boot
  native images, ensuring a smooth transition from development to production.\r\n\r\nKey
  Takeaways:\r\n\r\n- Leveraging Testcontainers for external resource validation:
  Learn how to use Testcontainers to ensure your native image interacts seamlessly
  with external systems like databases, queues, and caches.\r\n\r\n-Testing native
  images with RestAssured: See how to use the same RestAssured tests against both
  your JVM and native image builds, guaranteeing functional parity.\r\n\r\n- Efficient
  testing strategy: Learn how to save time and resources by focusing native image
  testing in your CICD pipeline, while ensuring confidence through earlier-stage validations.\r\n\r\nJoin
  this talk to gain practical insights and a step-by-step approach for testing Spring
  Boot native images with confidence. Feel the freedom to deploy with performance
  gains without sacrificing reliability."
