title: 30 Years of Java - How Did We Get Here?
description: "May 23rd, 1995, saw the launch of not just a new programming language
  but an entire development and deployment platform.  Initially targeted at the brand-new
  world of browsers and the World Wide Web, it quickly became the de facto standard
  for internet-scale enterprise applications.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, thirty years later,
  it is still always in the top three most popular languages in use by developers.\r\n\r\nHow
  did this happen?\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll take a whirlwind tour of the history
  of Java, recalling many of the milestones along the way.\r\n\r\nI started working
  for Sun Microsystems in February 1996, roughly the same week JDK 1.0 was launched.
  \ Through fourteen years at Sun, five at Oracle and nine at Azul, I’ll bring plenty
  of anecdotes (and some souvenirs).  Be prepared for some serious developer nostalgia!\r\n"
