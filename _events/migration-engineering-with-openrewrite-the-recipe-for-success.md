title: 'Migration Engineering with OpenRewrite: The Recipe for Success'
description: "How adaptable is your technology stack to changes in business requirements,
  technological advancements, and the availability of new and better tools? When you
  can more easily secure, upgrade, move, or modernize your code, that means you can
  adapt quickly and efficiently to changes in technology and markets. That’s what
  Migration Engineering is all about—and what we’ll be exploring in this workshop.\r\n\r\nWe’ll
  discuss and demonstrate how to create custom recipes using OpenRewrite, an open
  source auto-refactoring tool that enables large-scale code analysis and transformations.
  You’ll learn the make-up of recipes as we walk through a number of examples, then
  we’ll demonstrate how to write code search and transformation actions that are custom
  to your organization. We will assemble these recipes with the visitor pattern, and
  show how to stitch recipes together with YAML, with Refaster-style templates, with
  Semgrep matchers, etc. We’ll also show how Generative AI can be applied to accelerate
  recipe development. \r\n\r\nThis is a comprehensive look at all kinds of recipe
  development that will enable you to come away fully equipped to plan and exercise
  large-scale code transformations in your organization."
