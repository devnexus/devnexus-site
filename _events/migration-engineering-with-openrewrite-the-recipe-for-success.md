title: 'Migration Engineering with OpenRewrite: The Recipe for Success'
description: "How adaptable is your technology stack to changes in business requirements,
  technological advancements, and the availability of new and better tools? When you
  can more easily secure, upgrade, move, or modernize your code, that means you can
  adapt quickly and efficiently to changes in technology and markets. That’s what
  Migration Engineering is all about, which we’ll be exploring in this workshop.\r\n\r\nWe’ll
  discuss and demonstrate how to write custom recipes using OpenRewrite, an open source
  auto-refactoring tool that enables large-scale code analysis and transformations
  for your teams. You’ll learn the composition of recipes as we walk through a number
  of examples, then we’ll demonstrate how to write custom recipes using OpenRewrite.
  We will assemble these recipes with the visitor pattern, and show how to stitch
  recipes together with YAML, with Refaster-style templates, with Semgrep matchers,
  and more. We’ll also show how Generative AI can be applied to accelerate recipe
  development. \r\n\r\nThis is a comprehensive look at all kinds of recipe development
  that will enable you to come away fully equipped to plan and exercise large-scale
  code transformations in your organization.\r\n\r\nOutline\r\n\r\n* What is Migration
  Engineering? (15 minutes)\r\n* Introducing OpenRewrite (30 minutes)\r\n** From source
  code as text to the Lossless Semantic Tree\r\n** How the OpenRewrite community is
  organized\r\n* Recipe Exercise #1: change all integer literals to 42 (because 42
  is the answer to life, the universe, and everything) (30 minutes)\r\n* Recipe Exercise
  #2: fixing SAST issues with Refaster-style templates (30 minutes)\r\n* Recipe Exercise
  #3: finding and securing Personally Identifiable Information (1 hour)\r\n** Introducing
  search markers\r\n** Introducing Data Tables for impact analysis\r\n** Securing
  endpoints that expose PII\r\n* Recipe Exercise #4: finding and fixing SQL injection
  (1 hour)\r\n** Using OpenRewrite’s support for Semgrep-style local data flow analysis\r\n**
  Contributing a security recipe to the open source catalog of OWASP Top Ten recipes\r\n*
  Mass remediation: using our first recipes to issue pull requests or commits to many
  repositories at once (15 minutes)\r\n* Visualization #1: Visualizing the distribution
  of Gradle versions in a codebase (30 minutes)\r\n** Connecting Jupyter Notebooks
  to OpenRewrite Data Tables\r\n** Building a simple bar chart of Gradle version distribution
  across hundreds of repositories.\r\n* Visualization #2: Visualizing unused binary
  dependencies in Maven and Gradle projects (30 minutes)\r\n** Use of network analysis
  tools in Jupyter for visualizing large scale directed graphs\r\n* Where to integrate
  Migration Engineering into the SDLC (15 minutes)\r\n* Open recipe development lab
  (1.5 hours)\r\n* Demo: Using AI to jumpstart recipe writing"
