title: How I automated my life with MCP Servers
description: "Being a developer these days means you’re not only writing code, but
  also a Linux admin, a DevOps engineer, you name it! Thankfully, the Model Context
  Protocol (MCP) has made it significantly easier for me to ask my natural language
  questions, such as “What’s consuming the most memory in our dev cluster right now?”,
  and quickly receive a response. Hint: It was Prometheus!\r\n\r\nWhat you’ll learn
  in this session is a straightforward way to build your own local “AI Agent” using
  open source technologies to interact with various API’s and tools. We’ll take a
  look at the most common MCP Servers that developers are using today, think Git,
  Databases, Dev Tools, and more. Plus, we’ll have some fun, and chain multiple tools
  together to automate your daily standup!"
