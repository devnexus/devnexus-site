title: Event Driven Architecture & Event Streaming Workshop
description: "Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a design principle in which the flow
  of a systemâ€™s operations is driven by the occurrence of events, rather than direct
  communication between services or components. There are many reasons why EDA is
  a standard architecture for many moderate to large companies. It offers a history
  of events with the ability to rewind and perform real-time data processing in a
  scalable and fault-tolerant way. It provides real-time extract, transform, load
  (ETL) capabilities for near-instantaneous processing. EDA can be used as the communication
  channel in microservice architectures or with any other architecture.\r\n\r\nWorkshop
  Requirements:\r\nGithub account\r\n\r\nWorkshop Learnings:\r\n* Key Concepts of
  Event-Driven Architecture\r\n* Event Sourcing\r\n* Event Streaming\r\n* Multi-tenant
  Event-Driven Systems\r\n* Producers, Consumers\r\n* Microservice Boundaries\r\n*
  Stream vs. Table\r\n* Event Notification\r\n* Event Carried State Transfer\r\n*
  Domain Events\r\n* Tying EDA to Domain Driven Design\r\n* Materialized Views\r\n*
  Outbox Pattern\r\n* CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)\r\n* Saga Pattern
  (Choreography and Orchestrator)\r\n* Avoiding Coupling\r\n* Monitoring Systems\r\n*
  Cloud-Based EDA\r\n\r\nWe will do plenty of labs during the workshop for a hands-on
  experience.\r\n\r\nWorkshop Benefits:\r\nThis is for architects and developers who
  want to learn how to develop EDA systems. Since this workshop is hands-on, you will
  get a tactical understanding of how to roll out your systems. This workshop is also
  visual, with plenty of diagrams and animations to reinforce your learning experience.\r\n\r\nWorkshop
  Who Should Attend:\r\nArchitects, Developers, Data Engineers"
