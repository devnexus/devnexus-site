Hi, Spring fans! So much of the difficulty of microservices is not the services themselves, but the clients that connect to them. There are just so many things that can go wrong or cause bumps on the road to production! Clients may not speak the same protocols as the services to which they're connecting. Clients may need to adapt the data coming from services to suit their use cases, tailoring them to the user interface's particular requirements. Join me, Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long (@starbuxman) and we'll look at how to use reactive programming to build better API adapters, how to use Spring GraphQL to build better data integration gateways, and we'll look at Spring Cloud Gateway to build API gateways.
