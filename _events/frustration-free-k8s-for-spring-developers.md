title: Frustration-free K8S For Spring Developers
description: "Your first experience running a Spring app on Kubernetes likely left
  you wondering “How can I make this more efficient?”\r\n\r\nJust to get the app to
  run on Kubernetes, you likely had to: \r\n\r\nWrite a DockerFile to build a container.\r\nUpload
  that container to a registry your Kubernetes deployment can access. \r\nConstruct
  multiple lengthy YAML files.\r\nInstall a new CLI to apply those yaml files to the
  cluster.\r\nCross your fingers and hope that you did everything right and that the
  application actually started.\r\n\r\nIn the likely scenario where you messed something
  up your first time, you also needed to go back and try and figure out where it all
  went wrong!\r\n\r\nAll of that doesn’t even address the fact that your app likely
  needs some external services, such as databases or message queues. Also, how do
  you debug the application? How do you even view the logs?  How do you securely build
  a container?\r\n\r\nIf this experience resonates with you, then this session is
  for you. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we show you a variety of tools and techniques
  that turn deployments to Kubernetes from a multi-step nightmare into every developer's
  dream: a single automated process that happens quickly and easily.  You will leave
  this session no longer dreading deploying Spring apps to Kubernetes and instead
  making your deployments painless and intuitive, unlocking the true power of Kubernetes.\r\n"
