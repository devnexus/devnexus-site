title: 'Test-Driven Development: It''s easier than you think!'
description: "Everyone loves writing tests, don’t they? How do you write good tests?
  What tools are available for you to write good tests?\r\n\r\nIn this session, I
  will dive into the many features of Quarkus that help developers write good tests.
  I will highlight some of the features of Quarkus, Dev Services and Continuous Testing,
  which help make testing easier. Additionally, I will live code some tests for common
  use cases developers encounter, including unit, integration, and “black box” testing
  of imperative and reactive RESTful and event-driven applications that use common
  services, such as databases and Kafka brokers. I will discuss techniques such as
  mocking, spying, and interaction-based testing/verification.\r\n\r\nI'll even spend
  some time showing how IDE-based AI assistants can help!\r\n\r\nOnce you see how
  easy TDD really can be there isn't a reason to not do it!"
