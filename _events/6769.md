Hiding all the underlying protocol complexity makes gRPC really popular.  The framework makes all the decisions on how to layer an RPC model on top of HTTP/2. API designers and users are not exposed to low-level implementation details.

On the other hand, knowing these details may be necessary when troubleshooting and making performance optimizations in a real-life system. 

This talk provides practical advice on triaging gRPC interactions and achieving performance improvements - by covering technical details, starting with HTTP/2 frames and streams in gRPC. It also exposes the limitations of HTTP/2 and prepares the audience for the upcoming HTTP/3 standard and its integration with gRPC.

It is intended for current & potential gRPC users as well as engineers interested in exploring the benefits of HTTP/3.
