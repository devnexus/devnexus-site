  invisible threat, diving into the rise of malicious components that proliferate
  at an unprecedented rate.\r\n\r\nDiscover the stealthy tactics used to infiltrate
  networks, masquerading as legitimate software, and understand why traditional security
  solutions are failing. This session will provide the knowledge and tools to proactively
