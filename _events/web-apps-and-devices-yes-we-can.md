title: Web Apps and Devices â€“ Yes We Can!
description: "Device integrations have for decades been a problem for many business
  web apps. Input devices, printers, sensors and security gadgets would have their
  use case in many typical business apps. The \"sandbox\" by browsers has been worked
  around with several hacks ranging from browser plugins to native wrappers, but native
  apps have ruled when you need to connect to custom devices. Emerging new web standards
  may be changing the game forever.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will overview the possibilities
  (including workarounds and dirty hacks) to connect to various devices from your
  web apps. As a hands-on code example, we use Web Bluetooth API available in Chrome
  to collect ECG precise data from a wireless heart monitor belt. The row bytes are
  then sent over to the Java server for further analysis."
