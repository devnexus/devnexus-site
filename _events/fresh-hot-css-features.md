description: "Do you use a CSS Framework like bootstrap? Or maybe you've been coasting
  for a few years on your current knowledge of CSS. You've maybe seen something called
  CSS Grid and wondered what it was... Maybe you have never seen `var()` used before.\r\n\r\nLet's
  discuss the latest newest hottest big features in CSS from the last few years, and
  get you up to speed on what a browser engine is capable of!\r\n\r\nWe'll cover the
  following topics:\r\n- CSS Grid\r\n- Custom Properties\r\n- the `:has()` selector\r\n-
  CSS Layers\r\n- Container Queries\r\n\r\n... And more!"
