title: 'Beyond SWE-bench: Enterprise Java AI Agents and Real-World Development Benchmarks'
description: "AI coding agents have matured to the point that they need to be seriously
  considered for enterprise Java development and general SDLC tasks. CLI Tools like
  Claude Code, Google’s Gemini CLI, Amazon Q Developer, and OpenAI’s assistants are
  examples from leading large AI labs, but there are also smaller startups and open-source
  options. These agentic coding tools can reason about architecture, grok large code
  bases, and hold great promise to help developers ship software faster. They are
  often used in a “human in the loop” style, but they can also be instructed to execute
  autonomously until they determine the goal has been completed.\r\n\r\nThis talk
  introduces Spring AI Agents.  It provides a lightweight but powerful portable abstraction:
  the AgentClient. It acts as a consistent interface for invoking autonomous CLI-based
  agents. This allows developers to use the agentic tools they already have while
  providing flexibility to avoid locking into one single provider.   It also introduces
  Spring AI Bench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents on goal-directed enterprise-workflows.
  \ It evaluates how effectively different agents have completed their goals and can
  be considered the test harness that runs any agent via Spring AI Agents.\r\n\r\nThese
  autonomous tools represent a significant opportunity to offload routine, but complex,
  development tasks, allowing developers to focus on higher-level architecture decisions,
  creative problem-solving, and strategic technical leadership. May the best agent
  win!"
