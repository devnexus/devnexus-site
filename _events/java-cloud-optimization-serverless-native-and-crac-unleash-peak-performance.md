title: 'Java Cloud Optimization: Serverless, Native, and CRaC – Unleash Peak Performance'
description: 'Java in the cloud can be fast... really fast. This talk dives into the
  three key strategies for optimizing Java applications for peak performance in cloud
  environments: serverless architectures, GraalVM Native Image compilation, and Checkpoint/Restore
  in Containers (CRaC). We''ll explore how to leverage these technologies to reduce
  startup time, minimize resource consumption, and maximize throughput for your Java
  workloads. Learn how to choose the right approach for your application and unlock
  the full potential of Java in the cloud. Expect practical examples using the latest
