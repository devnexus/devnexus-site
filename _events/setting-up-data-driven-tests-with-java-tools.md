title: Setting up data driven tests with Java tools
description: Everyone knows that performing tests during development is the Right
  Thing to do. But how do we test data driven test cases? How can we ensure clean
  environments, reproducible outcomes, setting the database with the correct state,
  ensuring results match expectations, and so on? The Java ecosystem offers several
  options that we can leverage to answer these questions. In this session we'll cover
  how to configure data driven testcases with Testcontainers, setup database state
  and verify results with DbUnit and Database Rider, even test PL/SQL statements.
