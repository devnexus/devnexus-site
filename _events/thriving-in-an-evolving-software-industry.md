  world, from the reduction in development budgets to the introduction of AI tooling;
  proactive developers are adapting to the conditions on the ground exploring additional
  options to advance their career. What’s a busy developer to do? Being a software
  engineer is not limited to the act of writing code, there are a veritable plethora
  of options available to you. In this talk we’ll shatter some of the misconceptions
  that may have prevented you from trying something new and exciting. You will learn
  about the wide variety of roles within software, strategies to transition into another
  aspect of the technical field as well as gain practical advice on when to accept
  a new opportunity and when to stand pat.\r\nAs the market evolves and your preferences
  change, adding that new line to your resume can provide you that competitive edge.
  Join us as we uncover the diverse opportunities as well as practical steps to successfully
  pivot and thrive in a dynamic, ever-evolving industry. Technology changes constantly,
