title: Mastering Canary Releases with Argo Rollouts in Kubernetes
description: "Delivering new features without impacting user experience is a challenge
  for any modern application. Canary releases provide a safe way to gradually roll
  out changes, ensuring stability while reducing risk. In this session, we’ll explore
  how to implement fully automated canary releases using Argo Rollouts in Kubernetes.\r\n\r\nWe’ll
  cover the core concepts of canary deployments, progressive delivery strategies,
  and how Argo Rollouts integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes to manage traffic shifts
  and monitor metrics. To bring it all together, there will be a live demo showcasing
  a fully automated canary release in action—watch as we safely deploy updates in
  real time!\r\n\r\nJoin us to learn how to leverage canary releases for safer, more
  reliable software delivery."
