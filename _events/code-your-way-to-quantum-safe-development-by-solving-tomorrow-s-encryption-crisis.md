title: Code Your Way to Quantum-Safe Development by Solving Tomorrow’s Encryption
  Crisis
description: "As quantum computers threaten to break traditional encryption, major
  banks like Shinhan Bank and DBS are already testing quantum key distribution (QKD)
  networks. Meanwhile, Singapore has deployed the world’s first national quantum-safe
  network, and China operates a 2,000-kilometer quantum communication backbone. Meanwhile,
  Java JEPs 496 and 497 implement quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.\r\n\r\nIn
  this session, you’ll discover the fascinating world of quantum key distribution
  through Java code examples that demystify this cutting-edge security technology.
  You’ll explore the core principles behind QKD with Java simulations that demonstrate
  how quantum mechanics enables theoretically unbreakable communication.\r\n\r\nThis
  session shows how companies like Toshiba and ID Quantique are leveraging quantum
  theory to create real-world applications. You’ll leave this session with valuable
  insights into why this technology matters for the future of secure software development.\r\n\r\nWhether
  you’re curious about quantum computing’s impact on cybersecurity or want to understand
  the next generation of cryptographic protocols, this talk provides the practical
  foundation you need to engage with quantum-safe technologies as they move from research
  labs to production systems.\r\n"
