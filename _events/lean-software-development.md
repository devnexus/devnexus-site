title: Lean Software Development
description: The art of writing software is often cocooned in an overarching processes
  that sound like Agile and Lean. Those processes describe the delivery flow, the
  ability to go from requirements to working software and all of the SDLC steps in
  between. However, with the advent of LLMs now auto generating code, we have a maintenance
  issue wherein the knowledge of that code, the true usage of it and the optional
  semantic sugar sprinkled in becomes difficult to identify as time goes on. This
  gets greatly accelerated when the experience of the developer is simply not there.
  We always knew about Technical Debt, but are we prepared for the exponential rise
  in it as we embrace AI? Lean advocates for waste reduction, for a focus on standards,
  simplicity and the concept of value being added. This is a practice that software
  engineers simply have not been exposed to both in terms of how we write our code
  and how we protect our code equally.
