title: Autoscaling Spring Boot apps in Kubernetes with KEDA
description: 'The Horizonal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in Kubernetes has limited functionality
  in offering container CPU or Memory as metrics to monitor for pod scaling. However,
  the CNCF Graduated Project KEDA, short for Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling,
  offers a wide array of options. One of these includes using metrics exposed by Prometheus,
  another CNCF Graduated project.   Micrometer, an open-source metrics facade that
  integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot, can expose many different metrics from an
  application in a format that is understood by Prometheus. Come to this session to
  learn how you can put all of these together to use KEDA with out of the box Spring
  metrics or even with your own custom metrics to drive the autoscaling of your application
  in Kubernetes. '
