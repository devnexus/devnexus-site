Developers depend upon an ecosystem of open-source technologies that fuel innovation and decrease time to market. A typical business application is composed of >80% open source code, so what happens when the open source software supply chain gets hacked and thousands of enterprises are left exposed to potentially devastating security exploits. The SolarWinds hack is just the tip of the iceberg on a much larger security concern that spans the industry affecting all programming languages, platforms, and cloud services. In this keynote we will expose security holes and exploits in the open source ecosystem as well as propose a system for securing the software supply chain at a fundamental level.
