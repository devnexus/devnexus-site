title: Design Patterns for Multi-Agent Systems
description: 'Teams building AI beyond a single prompt now choose among different
  orchestration styles: mixture-of-experts (MoE) inside one model, multi-agent collaboration
  among specialized agents, and workflow/graph execution (e.g., task graphs with persistent
  state). This talk compares these approaches through concrete patterns—routing, planner-critic
  loops, reflection, shared memory, and tool use—and weighs the pros and cons. We’ll
  walk through a single task across all three styles. Attendees leave with a decision
  framework they can apply immediately to production systems.'
