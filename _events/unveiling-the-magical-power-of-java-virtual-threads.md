title: Unveiling the Magical Power of Java Virtual Threads
description: "Thread-per-request programming limits application scalability, leading
  developers to adopt thread sharing and asynchronous programming to better utilize
  hardware, though this introduces additional complexity. Creating reactive pipelines,
  debugging them, and visualizing their execution can be complicated tasks, compounded
  by the complexities that arise when exceptions occur.\r\nJava Virtual Threads enable
  applications to scale while preserving the thread-per-request style programming.
  Just as operating systems create the illusion of abundant memory by mapping a large
  virtual address space to limited physical RAM, a Java runtime can create the illusion
  of many threads by mapping numerous virtual threads to a few OS threads.\r\n\r\nIn
  this session, we’ll explore the mechanics of Java Virtual Threads, their use cases,
  and the APIs introduced by Project Loom. We’ll also examine how virtual threads
  perform in real-world scenarios—highlighting throughput, resource efficiency, and
  common pitfalls. Finally, we’ll compare traditional threads with virtual threads
  through practical programming examples to see their impact in action and discuss
  the broader implications for application design, debugging, and performance tuning."
