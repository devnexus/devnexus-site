title: 'Navigating Uncertainty in Software Development: Effective Planning Techniques'
description: "In an ever-changing world, uncertainty is a constant companion, especially
  in the realm of software development. Traditional heavy planning practices promise
  certainty and confidence yet fail to deliver results. This session explores practical
  techniques to help teams effectively plan and navigate through uncertainty, enabling
  them to move forward despite the presence of unknowns.\r\n\r\nAttendees will gain
  insights into:\r\n* Models for understanding problems (Cynefin Framework, and Rumsfeld's
  Known and Unknowns)\r\n* Multi-level approaches to addressing different types of
  uncertainty\r\n* Strategies for communicating plans and progress with confidence,
  even in uncertain circumstances\r\n\r\nThrough real-world examples, this session
  empowers attendees to embrace uncertainty and equips them with the tools necessary
  to guide their teams towards successful outcomes. Whether you are a developer, team
  lead, or product manager, this session will provide you with a fresh perspective
  on planning in the face of uncertainty."
