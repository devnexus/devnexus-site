title: Recalibrate - How AI Shakes Up Agile Teams
description: "According to researchers, a staggering 75% of enterprise software engineers
  will harness the power of AI code assistants by 2028. This shift will revolutionize
  not just how we write code but also the very essence of agile software development.\r\n\r\nAgile,
  a methodology born over 20 years ago, was crafted for a different era with its own
  unique challenges. While some principles remain timeless, others demand a fresh
  perspective in the age of AI-native development. Do we still need sprints when AI
  can prioritize tasks in real-time? And what happens to cross-functional teams when
  virtual specialists are at our fingertips?\r\n\r\nJoin Sven as he explores the evolving
  role of developers and the necessity to rethink human-to-human interaction in a
  world where AI is our primary coding companion. One thing is certain: we must recalibrate
  our collaboration strategies within software teams."
