title: Developer Experience != Developer Productivity
description: "With everything changing in tech at a frenetic pace, the emphasis on
  developer productivity has overshadowed the true essence of developer experience
  (DevEx). While frameworks like SPACE, getDX, and DORA metrics provide valuable insights,
  they often miss the mark on capturing developers' real, day-to-day experiences using
  tools and services, instead focusing strictly on the bottom line for the company.
  \r\nThis talk will explore the origins and evolution of \"developer experience,\"
  dissect popular frameworks, and advocate for a more balanced approach that values
  the practitioner's perspective. At the end we will set a path towards integrating
  top-down metrics with bottom-up feedback, ensuring an approach to developer experience
  that fosters innovation and satisfaction."
