To avoid getting caught up in notions of “the right tool” it is important to understand the core concepts of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery or continuous deployment (CD). Choosing the right tool should be a consequence of defining the right goals, metrics and processes to automate. In this session we will explore common ideas that must be present in commercial and open source solutions to monitor, automate, verify and deliver software. 
For example: Tasks, Steps, Runs, End-to-end automation, Workflows, Tool orchestration, Release cycles, among others.
