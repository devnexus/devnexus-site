title: Polyglot Pipelines with Apache Nifi
description: Are you feeling lost as a Java Developer in this new age where AI is
  becoming a part of our everyday toolkit?  Are you a Python Developer looking to
  scale up and distribute your data processing?  While Java has always been known
  for having strong libraries for processing data at scale; much of the advances in
  LLMs and RAG has been evolving in Python.  In this talk, we’ll cover building polyglot
  data pipelines on Apache Nifi. You’ll see how Apache Nifi can be integrated with
  Open Source libraries to train and evaluate models that process text and images.
  You’ll also learn how to integrate these workflows with popular Python libraries
  to take advantage of the mature libraries in the Python community like PyTorch or
  Tensorflow. Get the most out of your data by using the best of both the Java and
  Python communities.
