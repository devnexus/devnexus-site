title: Its Up To Java Developers to Fix Enterprise AI
description: "Enterprise AI is failing. The majority of enterprise Gen AI initiatives
  stall or fail to deliver expected value. Why? Because too many organizations have
  been treating AI as something alien to their existing systems, to be built by separate
  teams, using tools designed by people who don't understand or care about their requirements.\r\n\r\nIt's
  time for a course correction, bringing the Java community's proven application development
  skills to bear. The JVM runs many of the world's critical applications, and is ideally
  placed to AI enable them.\r\n\r\nIn this keynote, Rod Johnson will outline approaches
  for building agentic applications that work in production. These patterns share
  common themes: integration with what already works, structure where possible in
  place of text, and leveraging patterns and practices that work, like DDD and unit
  testing.\r\n\r\nRod will discuss topics including:\r\n\r\n- Structured Agent Interactions:
  Moving beyond strings to type-safe, testable agent code\r\n- Domain-anchored Agents:
  Why your existing domain model is your greatest AI asset, not an obstacle to work
  around. DICE (Domain Integrated Context Engineering) is the missing piece of context
  engineering\r\n- The superpower of tool methods on domain objects: Minimizing context,
  maximizing precision, and keeping sensitive data out of LLM calls\r\n- Agentic RAG:
  Combining retrieval with domain intelligence for applications that reason over business
  data and link customer interactions with existing entities.\r\n\r\nJava developers
  are uniquely positioned to turn the failure of enterprise Gen AI into success. The
  patterns and infrastructure we've built and modern Java frameworks facilitate are
  exactly what enterprise AI needs to succeed. The Embabel agent framework demonstrates
  that, far from playing catchup, the JVM can leapfrog other platforms.\r\n\r\nThe
  Python-first era of AI agents was a prototype phase. Production belongs to the JVM.
  Spring made enterprise Java work in the 2000s and can underpin making enterprise
  AI work in the 2020s."
