title: 'Technical Enshittification: Why Everything in IT is Horrible Right Now and
  How to Fix It'
description: "Did you notice how everything in IT is crap right now? Services are
  bloated, slow, and buggy, and the hardware requirements to run even the simplest
  applications are enormous. It’s not just me, right?  Everything is full of bugs,
  support is clueless, nothing works as described, and don’t even get me started on
  IoT protocols and the Cloud Native space. Oh, and how about taking half of the world’s
  air traffic offline because of a null pointer exception pushed to production without
  verification?\r\n\r\nAnd on top of what’s broken, the pace of innovation has crawled
  to a stop (except maybe in the AI space). There’s nothing materially new in the
  last ten versions of Android and iOS or the last hundred versions of Chrome and
  Firefox. Google spent months hyping a new login screen that ended up being just
  a rearrangement, and can you name one new exciting feature in any software older
  than five years (plugging in a ChatGPT bot doesn’t count)? When Facebook was bragging
  about breaking things, at least it was to move faster. What’s their excuse now?\r\n\r\nThis
  talk will dig into the reasons behind this technical decline, which we call “Technical
  Enshittification.” We’ll explore how technical debt, poor innovation practices,
  and stagnation in core products are dragging us down.\r\n\r\nWhile this talk probably
  won’t be able to fix the Googles, the Apples, and the Metas, we will focus on what
  you can do to prevent this decline in your own projects and companies.\r\n\r\nWe’ll
  discuss practical strategies to combat and prevent this mess, focusing on Developer
  Productivity Engineering (DPE), user-centered design, robust testing, and effective
  project management. Real-world examples will show how to keep IT services efficient,
  innovative, and user-friendly.\r\n\r\nJoin us to learn how to turn things around
  and ensure long-term success in today’s digital landscape."
