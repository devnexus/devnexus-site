title: Building AI Agents with Spring & MCP
description: 'AI is here, but is it working for you? The name of the game is to give
  these AI models access to our enterprise systems and services and let ‘er rip! But
  it’s not always easy. We have a friend whose stress level trying to build production-worthy
  Python AI services was so high that his hairline receded TWELVE INCHES! Or that
  might have just been natural aging... Either way: he should’ve used Spring AI! Join
  us, AWS developer advocate James Ward and his trusty sidekick and Spring developer
  advocate Josh Long, and we’ll look at how to build MCP-enabled, RAG-ready, vibe-free,
  agentic systems and services in no time at all.'
