title: Extend your JPA applications with Relational JSON documents
description: "Object Relational-Mapping (ORM) frameworks like Hibernate bridge object-oriented
  programming and relational databases, but they come with inherent limitations: complex
  mappings, lazy loading headaches, and gotchas like the N+1 query problem. Relational
  JSON documents provide an approach that combines the strengths of relational databases
  with the flexibility of JSON, and avoid common limitations of ORMs.\r\n\r\nIn this
  session, we'll generate relational JSON document views with existing Java Persistence
  API (JPA) annotations, and build a demo application that uses both relational tables
  and comprehensive JSON documents for read-write operations.\r\n\r\nBy the end, youâ€™ll
  understand:\r\n- Common ORM challenges and pitfalls\r\n- How to map relational tables
  to JSON documents for flexible data access\r\n- Writing practical demos that integrate
  this approach with Spring Boot and your database"
