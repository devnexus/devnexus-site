title: Building Engineers or Teaching Technicians?
description: "Organizations often focus on building software \"technicians\" instead
  of \"engineers.\" By using Platform or \"Enablement\" teams to create tools for
  developers, they impose standardized solutions that may not address the needs or
  challenges of teams most impacted.\r\n\r\nThis approach stifles critical thinking
  and problem-solving. Developers lack ownership and understanding of the tools they
  use, leading to inefficiencies and a disconnect between tools and the actual team
  needs. Organizations are creating technicians who can follow patterns but not engineers
  capable of solving complex, evolving problems. \r\n\r\nShifting the focus to developing
  engineers who solve their own problems, select appropriate tools, and create tailored
  design patterns will drive innovation and adaptability, accelerating progress."
