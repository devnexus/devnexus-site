title: TDD & generative AI - a perfect pairing?
description: "In this talk we will dive into the question whether generative AI can
  generate working code when we only provide test cases. So we take the main principle
  from TDD: we write the tests up front. Then we use a generative AI to create the
  code. If you wrote the tests correctly and they all pass, you should have a working
  prototype. Even better, if the tests pass and you trust the tests, the code is production
  ready!\r\n\r\nWith some live coding, we will explore this idea together. Furthermore
  we will take a look at the implications of this paradigm shift. After attending
  you should be able to apply this technique to your own project."
