title: A Data-Oriented Programming Approach to REST APIs
description: This session will use records, sealed interfaces, and pattern matching
  for switch to access RESTful web services. The approach takes advantage of concepts
  from Data-Oriented Programming like immutability, explicit data representations,
  and expressive behavior. At least one example will involve making text and vision
  requests to an AI service, and how to implement that effectively using Java 21+.
