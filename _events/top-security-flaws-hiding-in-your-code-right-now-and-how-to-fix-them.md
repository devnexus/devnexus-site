title: Top Security Flaws Hiding in Your Code Right Now – and How to Fix Them
description: "Security vulnerabilities aren’t just hypothetical—they’re real, from
  the MongoDB attack to the Log4Shell disaster,  and they’re hiding in your code right
  now. In this session, we’ll explore the most common and dangerous flaws: SQL Injection,
  Deserialization Injection, and Logging Injection. \r\n\r\nWe’ll explain how these
  vulnerabilities work, why they’re so risky, and how to fix them through examples.
  \r\n\r\nYou'll leave with practical tips for safeguarding your applications, including
  best practices for SQL query parameterization, secure deserialization techniques,
  the importance of sanitizing logs, and how to use tooling to prevent these flaws
  more easily.\r\n\r\nAudience Takeaways:\r\n\r\nDeep understanding of SQL Injection,
  Deserialization Injection, and Logging Injection.\r\nPractical code examples and
  fixes to secure your applications.\r\nInsights into real-world case studies of major
  security breaches.\r\nTooling that will help us to commit safe code."
