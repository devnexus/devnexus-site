title: 'Containers and Kubernetes made easy: Deep dive into Podman Desktop'
description: Dive into the world of containers and Kubernetes with Podman Desktop,
  an open-source tool to empower your container development workflow, and seamlessly
  deploy applications to local and remote Kubernetes environments. Podman Desktop
  provides an intuitive interface compatible with container engines such as Podman,
  Docker, Lima, and more for developers, operations, and those looking to simplify
  building and deploying containers. With an interactive live demo showing how to
  move from containers to Pods, to Kubernetes (all from your local machine), you’ll
  learn best practices in developing and deploying cloud-native applications. In addition,
  we’ll introduce the path to infusing your applications with Generative AI using
  the Podman AI Lab, to serve and inference open-source LLMs such as LLaMA & Mistral
  for quickly building and prototyping AI-enabled applications. Join us to learn how
  you can seamlessly adopt containers and ensure predictability in deployments on
  Kubernetes, through local clusters (with Kind and Minikube) and by leveraging Podman
  Desktop’s features and security advantages!
