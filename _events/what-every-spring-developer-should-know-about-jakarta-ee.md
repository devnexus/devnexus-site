title: What Every Spring Developer Should Know About Jakarta EE
description: "Even if Java was originally meant for clients, it soon turned out that
  it was a great fit for the server side as well. \r\nJ2EE came along and conquered
  this segment. Enterprise Java still powers the world with Spring as the dominant
  player.\r\n\r\nSo, what about Jakarta EE then? Most of the industry were affected
  in some way or the other by the namespace change from `javax.*` to `jakarta.*` in
  Jakarta EE 9, so there clearly are a lot of dependencies on the various Jakarta
  EE specifications.\r\n\r\nSpring is no exception. The framework builds on a surprisingly
  large set of Jakarta EE APIs and implementations. This means that it is a great
  advantage for a Spring developer to be aware of what is going on with the development
  of Jakarta EE.\r\n\r\nCome to this session to learn about the planned changes to
  the technologies that Spring depends on. There will be demos, and even some AI involved."
