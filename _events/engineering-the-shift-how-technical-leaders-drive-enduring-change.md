title: 'Engineering the Shift: How Technical Leaders Drive Enduring Change'
description: 'Rolling out a new tool or practice in a large engineering organization
  is easy, getting people to actually use it long-term is the real challenge. In this
  55-minute session, I’ll draw on two decades of experience leading zero-to-one initiatives
  at Coinbase, Ripple, and Yahoo to share the leadership styles, influence strategies,
  and measurement frameworks that turn forced adoption into sustained adoption. We’ll
  explore: the problem space and resistance patterns you’ll face, the techniques for
  aligning stakeholders without slowing execution, and the metrics that prove not
  just uptake, but enduring efficacy. Attendees will leave with a blueprint for leading
  change at scale, balancing persuasion with accountability, and ensuring that adoption
  sticks well beyond the launch announcement.'
