title: Developer To Architect
description: "Becoming a software architect is a longed-for career upgrade for many
  software developers. While the job title suggests a work day focused on technical
  decision-making, the reality is quite different. In this workshop, software architect
  Nathaniel Schutta constructs a real world job description in which communication
  trumps coding.\r\n\r\nDiscover the skill sets needed to juggle multiple priorities,
  meetings, and time demandsLearn why your best team leadership tool is not a hammer,
  but a shared cup of coffeeHear the best ways to give and take criticismUnderstand
  the necessity of writing effective email and formal architecture documentsGet tips
  for delivering confident career-building presentations to any audienceReview essential
  techniques for stakeholder management and relationship buildingExplore the critical
  needs for architecture reviews and an effective process for conducting themThrough
  lecture and small group exercises, Nathaniel will help you understand what it means
  to be a successful architect. Working through various problems, attendees will have
  opportunities to think through architectural decisions and patterns, discuss the
  importance of non functional requirements and why architects cannot afford to practice
  resume driven design."
