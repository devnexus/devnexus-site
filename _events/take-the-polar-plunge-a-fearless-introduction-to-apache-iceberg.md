title: 'Take the Polar Plunge: A Fearless Introduction to Apache Iceberg®'
description: "New to Apache Iceberg® or just starting to test the waters? Time to
  take the plunge! In this beginner-friendly session, we’ll introduce you to the core
  features of this high-performance table format and what it has to offer your data
  team as you build out your modern data lakehouse.\r\n\r\nWe’ll start by exploring
  where Iceberg fits within the context of data warehouses, data lakes, and other
  data storage formats. From there, you’ll be introduced to some of Iceberg’s key
  features, like schema evolution, hidden partitioning, and ACID-compliant transactions.
  You’ll see how these capabilities help to solve real-world challenges in scalability,
  performance, and data consistency. We won’t stop there, though! Next, we’ll go even
  deeper beneath the surface and explore the open-source tools, query engines, and
  catalogs that make up the Iceberg ecosystem. Through an end-to-end demo, you’ll
  see Iceberg in action and learn how you can leverage its features to streamline
  your data management and drive better insights.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the session,
  you’ll have the foundation you need to get started applying Iceberg to solve your
  own data challenges. So come along, and we’ll take the polar plunge together! "
