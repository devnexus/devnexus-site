Multithreading has been in Java from day one. The multithreading API has gone through significant changes over the years. And yet, we have something major that's threading again. What's the reason for yet another implementation, yet another change? How is that different from what we already have. When will we use the new model and when will we stick to the existing APIs.

Too many questions but we will not take them all in parallel. Instead we will give the questions serious thoughts and get a deeper understanding of the purpose of Project Loom, what problems it solves, and how and when we can benefit from it.
