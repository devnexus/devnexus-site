title: 'Stop Fighting Your AI: Engineering Prompts That Actually Work'
description: "Your prompts suck. Your AI outputs prove it.\r\n\r\nMost developers
  treat prompt engineering like magic - throw words at the AI and hope for the best.
  But getting consistent, production-quality results from AI requires actual engineering
  principles, not creative writing.\r\nThis session reveals the systematic approach
  to prompt engineering that produces reliable results: using AI itself to debug your
  prompts, building constraint systems that prevent garbage outputs, and creating
  prompt architectures that scale across your entire development workflow.\r\nYou'll
  master:\r\n- Why \"be creative\" prompts fail (and the structural patterns that
  don't)\r\n- How to reverse-engineer successful prompts using AI feedback loops\r\n-
  Constraint engineering that eliminates 90% of useless AI outputs\r\n- The prompt
  versioning and testing strategies that actually work in production\r\n\r\nPerfect
  for: Developers integrating AI into workflows, technical writers automating documentation,
  and anyone tired of playing prompt lottery with inconsistent results."
