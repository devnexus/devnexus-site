title: An All Code Introduction to Domain Driven Design and Hexagonal Architecture
description: "Domain Driven Design is designed for implementing complicated business
  logic and is an excellent fit for microservices development.\r\n\r\nDomain Driven
  Design provides a repeatable, logical structure that makes implementing business
  logic easier, faster, and more maintainable.  Hexagonal Architecture (or Ports and
  Adapters) excels at producing loosely coupled, interchangeable components that fit
  well with DDD.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation I will introduce the Domain Driven Design
  and dive into the DDD concepts of Aggregates, Repositories, Value Objects, Services,
  Ubiquitous Language, Adapters, and Shared Kernels.  I will also build an application
  using these patterns and leverage Hexagonal Architecture for easy extensibility.
  \ Testing will of course be included.\r\n\r\nYou will leave this presentation with
  a basic knowledge of Domain Driven Design, how to structure and test your application
  to implement DDD and how to use Hexagonal Architecture to extend your applications.\r\n\r\nNo
  slides; just live code."
