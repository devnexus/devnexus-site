title: 'BoxLang vs the World : From zero to stable in 20 months'
description: "We’re not Big Tech. We’re builders. In under two years, we went from
  zero to a stable, next‑generation dynamic JVM language — created by developers,
  for developers. And we did it by embracing the era we live in: the age of AI. From
  design to implementation, we leveraged AI tooling and techniques to move faster,
  think broader, and deliver sooner.\r\n\r\nCode changes. So should your language
  skills. One day, you’re building for the web. The next, for APIs, tablets, or serverless.
  The future is multi‑runtime. BoxLang is ready.\r\n\r\nDynamic. Modular. Productive.
  It’s expressive and functional, yet 100% Java‑compatible. It integrates anywhere,
  from legacy stacks to modern frameworks, with an instant Java ecosystem at your
  fingertips. Even a multi‑parser design lets you bring legacy code into a modern
  runtime without compromise.\r\n\r\nFrom a 6 MB OS binary to running on CommandBox,
  Jakarta EE, AWS Lambda, Microsoft Functions, IoT, and more — BoxLang adapts to every
  runtime you throw at it.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of how we built a language from
  scratch with strict goals: speed, flexibility, and developer‑first design — proving
  that in the age of AI, a small, passionate team can deliver significant innovations."
