title: 'Write Once, Deploy Everywhere: From Containers to Serverless'
description: "While Java apps are technically portable across many platforms, it can
  be tricky to not tightly couple them to specific deployment platforms, severely
  degrading their portability.  Unfortunately containers alone haven’t fully isolated
  us the myriad of differences across platforms.  This session will cover ways that
  we can build, package, and deploy Java applications so they remain portable.  This
  enables scaling from cost-efficient and developer environments, to massive scale
  Kubernetes deployments.  Using examples with Spring, you’ll learn how to:\r\n\r\n*
  Abstract service configuration / binding\r\n* Utilize Testcontainers across local
  dev/test & CI\r\n* Efficiently avoid cold starts with CRaC and other techniques\r\n*
  Package applications most efficiently for the target platforms"
