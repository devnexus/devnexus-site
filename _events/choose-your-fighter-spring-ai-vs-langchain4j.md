title: 'Choose your fighter: Spring AI vs LangChain4j'
description: As AI capabilities continue to integrate into modern enterprise applications,
  developers are seeking robust frameworks to streamline the interaction between large
  language models and Java-based systems. This talk offers some juxtaposition of Langchain4j
  and Spring AI, two emerging frameworks designed to simplify LLM integration in Java
  applications. We explore their core architectures, design philosophies, ease of
  use, extensibility, and integration with external services such as OpenAI, Azure
  AI, and vector stores. By highlighting key differences, we aim to provide practical
  insights into selecting the right tool for specific use cases. Whether you are building
  conversational agents, semantic search systems, or AI-driven automation, this session
  will help clarify which framework best aligns with your technical needs and development
  workflow.
