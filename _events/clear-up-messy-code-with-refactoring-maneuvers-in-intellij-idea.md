title: Clear up Messy Code with Refactoring Maneuvers in IntelliJ IDEA
description: "IntelliJ IDEA is an amazingly powerful development tool, providing automatic
  refactorings such as Extract Method, Introduce Parameter, and many more. But are
  you taking advantage of its full power? Do you stick with the Extract and Rename
  refactorings, because you're not sure how to use the more complicated ones?\r\n\r\nIn
  this session, you'll see how and when to use the many refactorings available to
  you. You'll learn about higher-level Refactoring Maneuvers, such as Cohere Method
  and Expose Details, and how they combine and sequence IntelliJ IDEA's automated
  refactorings to make your code more understandable and testable.\r\n\r\nThis session
  will cover:\r\n* Extract Method\r\n* Introduce Parameter\r\n* Move (Instance/Static)
  Method\r\n* Make Static\r\n* Inline Method\r\n* Introduce Constant\r\n* Extract
  Delegate (and Enum)\r\n* Introduce Field\r\n\r\nAlong the way you'll learn about
  a wealth of keyboard shortcuts to save your brain from having to think hard."
