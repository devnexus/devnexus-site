title: Crafting the Ultimate Docker Image for Spring Applications
description: Docker is the cornerstone of today's development! Let's overview quickly
  how we use it in JVM development, and then transition to practical examples. We
  will start with a simple Docker image containing a popular "one fat JAR" and look
  into its downsides (deployment speed, traffic volume). To address them, we will
  discuss the strategy of splitting the JAR into multiple layers and using multistage
  Dockerfiles, gradually improving our image. Join me to learn how to build the ultimate
  Docker image for Spring applications.
