title: 'The Accidental Leader: How to Succeed When You Weren’t Planning to Lead'
description: "One day, you’re just doing your job—writing code, managing projects,
  or contributing to a team—and the next, you’re in charge. Whether it’s by necessity,
  opportunity, or pure accident, many tech professionals find themselves in leadership
  roles without formal training or preparation. So, what now?\r\n\r\nThis talk is
  for those who never set out to be leaders but suddenly find themselves responsible
  for teams, projects, or communities. We’ll explore the essential skills that make
  accidental leaders successful, from navigating imposter syndrome to managing up,
  down, and across. Through real-world stories, practical strategies, and lessons
  learned the hard way, you’ll gain the confidence and tools to lead effectively—without
  losing yourself in the process."
