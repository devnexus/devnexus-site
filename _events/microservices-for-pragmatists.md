title: Microservices for Pragmatists
description: "Microservices architecture is often perceived as a pattern primarily
  suited for large organizations operating at web scale. However, it is equally applicable
  to smaller to medium-sized applications for internal use or smaller-scale public
  deployments. The scalability benefits of microservices are one of the compelling
  reasons to consider this architectural pattern.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we
  will explore the advantages and trade-offs associated with microservices. You will
  gain insights into the architectural patterns of microservices from a practical
  perspective. Real-world software development scenarios often present unique constraints;
  this presentation will guide you in identifying the aspects of microservices that
  align with your projectâ€™s requirements while ensuring compliance with the constraints.\r\n\r\n\r\nLearning
  objectives:\r\n\r\n* Benefits of microservices for small/medium scale deployments\r\n*
  Trade-offs associated with microservices\r\n* How to pragmatically apply microservice
  design principles for your projects"
