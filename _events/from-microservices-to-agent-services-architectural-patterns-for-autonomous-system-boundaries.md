title: 'From Microservices to Agent-Services: Architectural Patterns for Autonomous
  System Boundaries'
description: "The rise of Agentic AI is introducing a paradigm shift in the microservices
  architecture: services are becoming autonomous agents that can redefine their own
  boundaries, merge capabilities with other services, or split responsibilities based
  on learned optimization patterns. That is why microservices are no longer passive
  components but autonomous actors with their own architectural opinions and the ability
  to act on them.\r\nIn addition, traditional architectural patterns break when services
  become goal-seeking agents. Unexpected coupling emerges, contracts drift autonomously,
  data consistency becomes unpredictable, and governance blind spots multiply. Therefore,
  we need new patterns that let agents optimize while preserving system correctness.\r\n\r\nThis
  session tackles the fundamental challenge every architect will face in 2026: How
  do you maintain architectural integrity, ensure system reliability, and validate
  correctness when your services are autonomous actors that can redesign themselves?\r\n\r\nIn
  this session you will learn a taxonomy of agent-driven boundary changes with concrete
  examples, architectural patterns that preserve integrity while enabling autonomous
  evolution and testing methodologies specifically designed for non-deterministic
  and self-modifying systems. \r\n"
