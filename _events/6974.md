This talk will cover some of the basics of how to get started with metrics and getting your simple java application to have monitoring. Not only will we cover which metrics are best for SLIs and when and what your SLOs should be, but also when to incorporate logs and tracing, as well as metrics. Participants will expect to leave knowing some observability basics and how to use the monitoring to understand system health and avoid some potential incidents.
