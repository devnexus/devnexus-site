title: 'Project Panama: Unleashing native libraries'
description: Many native libraries offer powerful solutions to interesting problems
  that could greatly benefit Java developers. However, working with native code has
  traditionally been difficult on the Java platform. One had to contend with the boiler
  plate of writing JNI code in order to interact with native libraries. And it only
  got worse when trying to use native types, like structures, that have no java equivalent.
  Project Panama solves all these issues by introducing an FFI and Memory Access APIs
  that lets Java developersâ€™ interop with native code seamlessly. Come to this session
  to learn more about how OpenJDK Project Panama can help you interact with native
  libraries seamlessly.
