description: "DB Associations as Networking Patterns: A Developer's Guide to Professional
  Connections\"\r\n\r\nThis  talk reimagines professional networking through the familiar
  lens of database associations, making relationship-building more approachable for
  developers. By mapping associations to networking scenarios, we'll transform technical
  knowledge into effective social strategies.\r\n\r\nTalk Overview\r\nWe'll explore
  how common Rails/ db associations parallel networking patterns:\r\n- `belongs_to`:
  Building one-on-one mentor/mentee relationships\r\n- `has_many: through`: Leveraging
  existing connections for introductions\r\n- `has_and_belongs_to_many`: Engaging
  with tech communities and groups\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways:\r\n1. A technical framework
  for understanding networking dynamics\r\n2. Practical strategies tailored for introverted
  developers\r\n3. Implementation techniques for each \"association type\"\r\n4. Tools
  to measure networking effectiveness\r\n5. Actionable steps for immediate application\r\n\r\nThis
  session bridges the gap between technical expertise and professional relationship
  building. You'll gain:\r\n- Structured approaches to networking that align with
  developer thinking\r\n- Concrete examples of successful networking patterns\r\n-
  Implementation strategies for various career stages\r\n- Methods to convert technical
  knowledge into social capital\r\n\r\nTarget Audience:\r\n- Developers of all levels
  seeking to grow their professional network\r\n- Engineering leaders aiming to strengthen
  team connections\r\n- Community organizers building tech communities\r\n\r\nWhether
  you're starting your career or leading a team, this talk provides a systematic approach
  to networking that feels natural to technical minds. You'll leave with practical
  tools to build and maintain professional relationships using familiar patterns from
  your daily work."
