title: AI for Busy Java Developers
description: "Yep, we know you're knee-deep in production Java deployments and don’t
  exactly have time to learn about AI.  But your manager and the senior executives
  in your company are mentioning “AI” seemingly at every meeting.  And you’re watching
  unsettling YouTube posts about how GenAI will take your job or that 90% of all AI
  projects fail.  Pretty scary, right?\r\n\r\nIn this session, I will fast-track you
  through AI/ML focused on Java developers who need to get the job done without the
  need to drill down into data science and complicated math. \r\nThis presentation
  is designed for junior and intermediate Java developers who need to understand how
  non-deterministic tools can be effectively utilized throughout the software development
  process. You will gain a practical introduction to AI and Machine Learning with
  a focus on the Java ecosystem, featuring hands-on coding using LangChain4j, ChatGPT,
  Claude, Gemini, and other APIs. \r\n\r\nThis session will cover how neural networks
  and large language models (LLMs) process information, how to craft effective prompts
  and manage context, and how to use embeddings and vector databases to support Retrieval
  Augmented Generation (RAG) for helpful responses. We will explore reusable prompt
  templates, the building blocks of chatbot architectures, and provide a brief introduction
  to agents, all while learning how to integrate GenAI in an ethical and responsible
  manner and manage potential risks. \r\n\r\nBy the end of this presentation, you
  should understand the very essence of AI/ML, so that you will understand what AI
  is and how to use it for successful deployments properly.  \r\n"
