title: AI for Busy Java Developers
description: "Yep, we know you're knee-deep in production Java deployments and don’t
  exactly have spare time to learn about AI.  But your manager is talking more about
  AI every day, and you’re reading unsettling posts about how GenAI will take your
  job.  In this session, we’ll fast-track you through AI and Machine Learning concepts—tailored
  just for Java developers who need to learn the basics without the need to drill
  down into data science and complicated math. We’ll cover all the basics and explain
  how AI can be used in the software development process beyond simple code generation.
  \ You’ll walk away understanding where AI fits (and doesn’t fit), grasp its ethical
  concerns, become more valuable, and enhance your career.\r\n\r\n* Why AI Matters
  to Developers and Your Career\r\n* Importance of Patterns\r\n* Predictive AI (PredAI)
  vs Generative AI (GenAI)\r\n* GenAI vs. Traditional Search Engines\r\n* Prompt Techniques\r\n*
  The Importance of Context for GenAI\r\n* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems\r\n*
  Fine-tuning vs RAG\r\n* Java Libraries for AI/ML\r\n* AI and the Software Development
  Process\r\n* Responsible AI and Ethics\r\n"
