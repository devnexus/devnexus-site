title: What's new in Spring Boot 4.0 & what's arriving 4.1
description: Spring Boot 4.0 arrived November 2025 and Spring Boot 4.1 will be here
  this May. There are a host of new changes to discuss and in this talk we'll cover
  all the updates, why they happened and how they might impact you. We'll demo new
  features, including REST API versioning and Interface Clients (where you can quickly
  convert a Java interface into a fully-fledged HTTP client). Finally we'll look at
  what we're planning to deliver in 2026.
