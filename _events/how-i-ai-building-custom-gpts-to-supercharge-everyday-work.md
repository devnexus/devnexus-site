title: 'How I AI: Building Custom GPTs to Supercharge Everyday Work'
description: "AI isn’t just for coding—it’s a force multiplier for every role. In
  this talk, I’ll show how I use AI daily to automate work, analyze complex projects,
  and tailor content—without being a traditional developer.\r\n\r\nFrom writing automation
  scripts in Google Apps Script and Excel, to analyzing R&D projects for tax credit
  eligibility, to summarizing dense articles into concise insights, AI has become
  my on-demand assistant.\r\n\r\nI’ll also share how I built custom GPTs that review
  my presentations based on audience personas, identifying gaps in tone, content,
  and clarity—turning a standard deck into a laser-focused message.\r\n\r\nThis session
  is for anyone who wants to move past the AI hype and see concrete, repeatable workflows.
  You’ll leave with ideas, prompts, and frameworks you can apply tomorrow."
