title: Deep dive into data streaming security
description: "Data streaming is powering everything from fraud detection and real-time
  analytics to patient monitoring and order fulfillment. But as the role of streaming
  grows, so does the risk - because many streaming platforms, like Apache Kafka, aren't
  secure by default.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll take a practical look at data streaming
  security through the lens of Kafka, one of the most widely adopted streaming platforms
  in the world. We'll walk through what can go wrong - like Gamooga's public Kafka
  broker leaking 17GB of customer data in two hours, or GonnaOrder exposing years
  of real-time delivery info to the internet - and what it takes to do it right.\r\n\r\nWe'll
  cover the key pillars of securing a streaming system: encryption in transit and
  at rest, access control, monitoring, and key management. Along the way, we’ll look
  at the trade-offs like disk encryption vs. end-to-end encryption, what is behind
  field-level and envelope encryption, and the realities of using customer-managed
  keys in regulated industries.\r\n\r\nWe'll also explore how streaming security has
  evolved, how real vulnerabilities (like CVE-2019-12399) highlight the need for patching
  and monitoring, and what successful multi-layered security looks like in production
  - from financial institutions to healthcare platforms.\r\n\r\nIf you're building,
  running, or scaling streaming systems, this talk will help you see the security
  blind spots and give you concrete steps to protect the data flowing through your
  pipelines."
