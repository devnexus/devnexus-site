title: 'AI’s Big Leap: From Sidekick to Autonomous, Multi-repo Refactoring Powerhouse'
description: "Generative AI can be a force multiplier for developers, but it also
  comes with limitations. Developers are expected to co-create with AI, and check
  the generated output, or risk hallucinations running wild. This can aid development
  at a local machine, but what happens when you try to apply these tools on a massive
  scale?\r\n\r\nFor mass-scale code operations, AI needs to have agency, able to operate
  with some degree of autonomy. In this session, we’ll cover how you can use use techniques
  such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG), the richest code data source for Java
  called the lossless semantic tree (LST), and OpenRewrite rules-based recipes to
  drive more efficient and accurate AI model output for refactoring and analyzing
  large codebases.\r\n\r\nWe’ll specifically address how you can use AI embeddings
  as a powerful tool to visualize, analyze, and even do smarter sampling for your
  codebase. We’ll demonstrate using embeddings to perform searches, cluster data,
  get a birds-eye view of your codebase, as well as diagnose issues and recommend
  OpenRewrite recipes to fix the problem. We'll also show you how GenAI can be helpful
  at scale: by assisting with writing OpenRewrite deterministic recipes.\r\n\r\nCome
  learn the technical underpinnings for reliably using AI at scale for code modernization."
