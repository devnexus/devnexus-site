title: Foundations of Modern Java Server Apps
description: Java has a long history of running on the server. From the early days
  of servlets, to JSP, Java web frameworks, Java  EE, and Spring, to today’s hip microservice
  frameworks, the platform has been a strong, solid player, relied upon by thousands
  of companies, governments, and organizations. But what do these microservice frameworks
  like Dropwizard, Spring Boot, and Eclipse MicroProfile have in common with the older
  days of Java? It turns out, there’s quite a lot of foundational tech that made the
  newer frameworks possible. In this talk, we’ll take a look at different parts of
  the foundation that you may not even realize you’re using, for everything like handling
  REST requests, processing JSON, using Web Sockets, talking to a database, performing
  validation, and more. We’ll also look at how these standards evolve within the Eclipse
  Jakarta EE, and what’s in store for the future.
