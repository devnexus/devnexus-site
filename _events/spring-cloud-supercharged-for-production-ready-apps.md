title: Spring Cloud Supercharged for Production-Ready Apps
description: "Spring Cloud's open-source components are incredibly powerful—they provide
  robust foundations for service\r\ndiscovery, configuration management, API routing,
  and data pipelines right out of the box. Many developers have\r\nbeen relying on
  these open source projects for years to build cloud native applications that hundreds
  of millions\r\nof people use every day. As with any open source project, using Spring
  Cloud in production often requires extra\r\neffort to conform to additional standards
  around security, resiliency, and management capabilities. In some cases\r\nit makes
  sense to build the necessary capabilities yourself, but what if there is a done-for-you
  solution that takes\r\nthe open source Spring Cloud components and allows you to
  bring them to production out of the box. Enter the\r\nSpring Cloud offerings from
  VMware Tanzu Platform. With API Gateway, Tanzu Data Flow, and Application\r\nServices
  on Tanzu Platform, you get all the power of open source Spring Cloud with production-ready\r\ncapabilities
  like integrated OAuth2/JWT security, advanced rate limiting, visual pipeline editors,
  and managed\r\nservice instances—ready to go for all your production use cases.
  This code-centric session will explore both the\r\nopen source and commercial Spring
  Cloud offerings through real-world scenarios, so no matter which route you\r\nchoose,
  you will have all the knowledge you need to build secure, scalable applications
  faster."
