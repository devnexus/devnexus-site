title: 'Breaking the Monolith Mindset: Hexagonal Architecture vs Traditional Layers
  in Java'
description: "Traditional layered architectures (controllers, services, repositories)
  have been the default choice for many Java applications. While simple to start with,
  they often lead to tightly coupled code, difficult testing, and limited flexibility
  as systems grow. Hexagonal Architecture (a.k.a. Ports and Adapters) offers an alternative—one
  that places business logic at the center and decouples it from external concerns.\r\n\r\nWhat
  you’ll learn:\r\n\r\n\U0001F539Key differences between traditional layered architecture
  and hexagonal architecture\r\n\U0001F539Why hexagonal promotes cleaner boundaries
  and domain-driven design\r\n\U0001F539Practical benefits: easier testing, maintainability,
  and adaptability to change\r\n\U0001F539Common pitfalls when migrating from layered
  to hexagonal\r\n\U0001F539Real-world scenarios where hexagonal shines (and when
  traditional still works)\r\n\U0001F539Hands-on Java examples to illustrate both
  approaches\r\n\r\nBy the end, you’ll understand how to evaluate when to stick with
  a layered approach and when adopting hexagonal can future-proof your Java applications."
