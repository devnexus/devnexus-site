title: 'How to debug: Lessons learnt from 10 years of Spring Boot'
description: Debugging is a fundamental skill that's vital for any Java developer,
  but how many techniques do you really know? 10 years of running the Spring Boot
  project has given plenty of real-world examples of nasty issues and how to debug
  them. Lets go beyond simple breakpoints, look at problems raised in the project,
  and discuss how to actually fix them! Dealing with regressions, using the remote
  debugger and tips for conditional breakpoints will all be covered. You'll also learn
  how to open good issues against open source projects to quickly get the fixes you
  need.
