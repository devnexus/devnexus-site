title: 'Securing LLM-Powered Applications: Overcoming Security and Privacy Challenges'
description: "LLMs accessing the database and intelligent agents that perform online
  purchases? The possibilities for AI in applications seem endless but so are their
  security and data privacy risks. In this session, we’ll address common issues such
  as prompt injection, key leakage, abuse of private customer data for model training,
  legal restrictions, and more. In addition, we will show that general security issues
  in your systems can also influence the behavior and outcome of LLMs. \r\nDuring
  this session, you’ll get a solid overview of the vulnerabilities to avoid, strategies
  to ensure data privacy compliance and best practices for building secure LLM-powered
  applications."
