title: Sociotechnical Platform Engineering
description: "devOps practices help reduce friction to production for technologists.
  Once an application has user traffic, user experience should become a priority,
  but at what cost?\r\n\r\nThis talk will connect human centered devOps & SRE practices
  across compute, data, and AI value streams to illustrate how platforms balance developer
  experience against production stability over time and how process dependencies factor
  into overall platform success.\r\n\r\nthis talk will Explore:\r\n* How pipelines
  are value streams\r\n* A general-purpose value stream map for platforms\r\n* Value
  Stream Maps (VSMs) for Compute, Data, & AI\r\n* Dependency (wardley) maps for platform
  processes\r\n* Aligning SLIs, SLOs, & SLAs across our platform VSMs\r\n* Establishing
  Error Budgets\r\n* Chaos Engineering & Complexity Science\r\n\r\n*updated & extended
  with new social practices for 2026*"
