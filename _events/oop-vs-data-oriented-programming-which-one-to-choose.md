title: 'OOP vs. Data Oriented Programming: Which One to Choose?'
description: "We rely heavily on polymorphism when programming with the object-oriented
  paradigm. That has served us really well, especially to create extensible code.
  However, like any tool and technique, there are times when that may not be the right
  choice. Java now provides an alternative that is useful in those select situationsâ€”the
  data-oriented programming.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will start with an example
  where the highly useful object hierarchy and polymorphism appears as a misfit and
  discuss how data-oriented programming solves the problem more elegantly. Get a good
  understanding of when to use each one of these and how to intermix them in your
  applications."
