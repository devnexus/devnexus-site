The release of the JDK 17 brings interesting features in the Java language: sealed types and pattern matching for switch (as a preview feature). Along with the introduction of records, the implementation of pattern matching in the Java language begins to take shape. The JDK 18 brings even more with Record pattern matching (as a preview feature). In this presentation we show you how leveraging these features can bring very clean solutions to improve the modularity of your application. You will see on real patterns how pattern matching can change the way you write Java code. You will also see what we can expect on this topic in the future. It is mostly a live coding presentation, with some slides when the code shown cannot be executed.
