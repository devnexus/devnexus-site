title: 'Agentic AI for Java Microservices: Cloud Performance Optimization at FinTech
  Scale'
description: Modern enterprise Java systems handle millions of financial transactions
  every day. Yet scaling them reliably and cost-effectively in the cloud is a constant
  challenge. This session introduces Agentic AI for Java microservices, an approach
  that integrates autonomous agents directly into your architecture to achieve self-optimization,
  predictive scaling, and real-time performance tuning. Drawing on my experience in
  FinTech and cloud-native systems, I will share architecture patterns, code examples,
  and lessons learned from building high-volume transaction platforms. Attendees will
  learn how to evolve from traditional auto-scaling to AI-driven self-optimization
  and leave with a practical roadmap for implementing these techniques in their own
  Java applications.
