If you have been delivering in an agile workflow, you are probably familiar with some variation of a team made up of a product owner, scrum master, and engineers, sometimes with considerable overlap. Regardless of your team’s make-up, there is often a dynamic including a product entity and a technical entity. This talk will address common discomfort zones between these groups and bring light to many different practices that allow product and tech to work together to not only create top notch products, but also have a lot of fun together!
