title: The wrong reasons to build an MCP server
description: "We’ve built multiple MCP servers—enough to know where they shine, and
  where they hurt. MCP is powerful: it standardizes how LLMs connect with tools, prompts,
  and resources. But here’s the hard truth: not every use case deserves an MCP server.
  Sometimes it’s just overhead, slowing you down when a plain SDK or direct API call
  would have worked better.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we’ll share lessons learned from
  real MCP builds: the wins, the painful over-engineering, and the “wish we hadn’t
  done that” moments. You’ll see common anti-patterns like wrapping trivial APIs,
  using MCP as a database proxy, or introducing it in environments where latency and
  lifecycle management become a nightmare.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, we’ll give you
  a practical checklist to decide when MCP is worth it—and when it’s simply the wrong
  tool. You’ll walk away with clear guidance, battle-tested stories, and the confidence
  to avoid the mistakes we made.\r\n\r\nContents of the workshop: \r\nPart 1: The
  API Trap\r\nPart 2: The Right-Sized Use Case\r\nPart 3: Choose your game: Chatbot,
  MCP, Agent\r\nPart 4: Decision Framework in Action\r\n\r\nLearning Benefits and
  Takeaways: \r\n- Not every integration needs an MCP server—sometimes it’s just overhead.\r\n-
  Learn to spot common anti-patterns (wrapping trivial APIs, database proxies, FOMO-driven
  builds).\r\n- A decision checklist to evaluate MCP vs. simpler options.\r\n- Understand
  when MCP adds real value: interoperability, tool ecosystems, complex workflows.\r\n-
  Lessons learned from real-world MCP implementations—what worked, what didn’t."
