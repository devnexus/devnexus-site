title: The wrong reasons to build an MCP server
description: "We’ve built multiple MCP servers—enough to know where they shine, and
  where they hurt. MCP is powerful: it standardizes how LLMs connect with tools, prompts,
  and resources. But here’s the hard truth: not every use case deserves an MCP server.
  Sometimes it’s just overhead, slowing you down when a plain SDK or direct API call
  would have worked better.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll share lessons learned from
  real MCP builds: the wins, the painful over-engineering, and the “wish we hadn’t
  done that” moments. Most importantly, we’ll give you a practical checklist to decide
  when MCP is worth it—and when it’s simply the wrong tool. You’ll walk away with
  clear guidance, battle-tested stories, and the confidence to avoid the mistakes
  we made."
