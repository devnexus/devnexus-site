title: Agents, Tools, and MCP, oh my! Next-level AI concepts for developers
description: "AI is evolving fast, and so are the ways developers can integrate it
  into tech systems. A flurry of new approaches and tools surfaces every week, and
  it's hard to know where to focus.\r\nIn this session, we will pull back the curtain
  on the next wave of AI development with agents, tool integrations, and Model Context
  Protocol (MCP). We will break down what AI agents are, how they interact with tools
  and APIs, and why context is critical for building smarter, more reliable applications.
  Next, we will look at MCP and how it standardizes communication between AI models
  and external systems.\r\nAlong the way, we will touch on related concepts and step
  through code and demos, giving you a complete roadmap to level up your AI skills.
  You won't need a yellow brick road to follow along, but you will discover some magical
  new tricks to level up your AI skills!"
