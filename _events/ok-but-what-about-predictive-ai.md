title: OK, But What About Predictive AI?
description: "While the tech world is buzzing about generative AI and large language
  models (LLMs), it's easy to forget that predictive AI has been, and continues to
  be, the real engine behind most AI-powered applications. From fraud detection to
  demand forecasting, predictive models are embedded in nearly every industry.\r\n\r\nThis
  talk takes a fresh look at the state of predictive AI in the Java ecosystem. We'll
  explore how traditional machine learning is still very much alive, practical, and
  evolving, especially with recent improvements in model efficiency, portability,
  and tooling.\r\n\r\nYou'll see real-world examples of predictive AI in action and
  discover some of the Java libraries, frameworks, and platforms that make it all
  work, from model training to serving. Whether you're new to AI or looking to balance
  your GenAI hype with some grounded, production-ready solutions, this session will
  reconnect you with the part of AI that’s still doing the heavy lifting."
