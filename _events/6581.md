Software development has changed dramatically in recent years; no longer can you afford to say, “That’s how we’ve always done it.” Applications are evolving rapidly, which requires you to move fast and fix things. And don’t neglect the cultural shift inherent in any technical change. (Some developers, for instance, reject build-break notifications, going so far as removing themselves from the email list.) If you’re just starting your CI/CD journey, you must ensure everyone understands the benefits, including increased speed-to-market, stable builds, and reduced drama around releases. That way, CI/CD won’t just help you deliver for your customers—it will help you sleep better at night.
