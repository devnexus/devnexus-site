While many attendees learn from abstract concepts, others prefer to see concepts in action. This session eschews software architecture theory and instead illustrates the process of architecture design using two concrete examples: Silicon Sandwiches and Going, Going, Gone. For each of these problems, Neal shows how:

1. to determine architecture characteristics
2. to find architecture quanta
3. to scope architecture characteristics
4. to create and iterate on component design
architecture characteristics & component design leads to architecture style selection
5. to document important architecture decisions

Each step of the way, the two example problems illuminate the stages of architecture design and the considerations architects must make at each stage.
