title: 'From Monolith to AI Agent: Modernizing Java Systems with MCP'
description: "Many Java systems power critical enterprise workflows but struggle to
  integrate with modern AI capabilities without expensive rewrites. The Model Context
  Protocol offers a new integration path by letting your existing Java services talk
  to LLMs as first-class citizens.\r\n\r\nThis talk walks you through refactoring
  a legacy Java application into an AI-enabled agent using MCP. We’ll cover practical
  patterns for exposing services, handling tool calls, and streaming results plus
  strategies for controlling and auditing AI actions in production. You’ll see how
  MCP lets Java stay relevant in the fast-moving AI ecosystem without sacrificing
  stability."
