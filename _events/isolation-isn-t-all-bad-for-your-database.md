title: Isolation Isn't All Bad, For Your Database
description: 'Let''s review a fundamental of our databases: Isolation levels. Choosing
  transaction settings is something we''ve all done a few times then can forget about
  them until next time. Going back over the basics, tradeoffs of concurrency and integrity,
  keeps understanding sharp and minimizes time searching for the answer next time
  starting something new. A refresher for the experienced dev who likes to talk about
  the details or maybe even an eye opening introduction to the unfamiliar.'
