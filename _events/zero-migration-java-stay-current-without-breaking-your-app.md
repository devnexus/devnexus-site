title: 'Zero Migration Java: Stay Current Without Breaking Your App'
description: "Keeping enterprise Java applications secure and up-to-date is critical
  but traditional runtime upgrades often come with painful migrations, broken dependencies,
  and retesting cycles. What if you could upgrade your runtime without touching your
  code?​\r\nIn this session, we’ll explore the concept of zero migration — a runtime
  model that allows Java applications to stay current with the latest patches and
  features without requiring code or configuration changes. You’ll learn how this
  approach works in practice, why it’s a game-changer for regulated and mission-critical
  workloads, and how it fits into modern CI/CD and GitOps workflows. We’ll walk through
  real-world examples using modern runtimes like Liberty, and show how zero migration
  helps teams move faster, stay secure, and reduce technical debt."
