title: DataFrame - a Swiss Army Knife of Java Data Processing
description: "Can we use big data techniques without big data infrastructure? As Java
  developers, we deal with data processing all the time: analyzing app logs, extracting
  data from Excel, copying tables between databases, to give some examples. Yet, the
  “standard” Java falls short in processing capabilities compared to more complex
  and heavy tools like Spark or Flink.\r\n\r\nThis talk is about “DataFrame” - a 2-dimensional
  in-memory table structure that provides filtering, column / row operations, joins,
  aggregations, window functions, etc. I will use an open source DFLib library (https://dflib.org)
  and a Jupyter notebook to demonstrate how to do data processing and visualization
  in a Java app with DataFrames without much fuss.\r\n"
