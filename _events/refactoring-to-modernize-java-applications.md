title: Refactoring to Modernize Java Applications
description: "IDEs have provided ways to refactor code for a long time now. In spite
  of their effectiveness, that journey is arduous and time consuming. Reluctance to
  refactor increases the cost of development. However, refactoring for the sake of
  doing so can lead to greater productivity loss as well.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation
  we will use data driven approach. We will take examples of code, measure code quality,
  and then use automated code transformation tools to refactor the code, and then,
  once again, measure the quality of code and see how much we have improved. This
  can help us to not only refactor faster but also see the benefits realized and motivate
  us to move faster with greater efficiency."
