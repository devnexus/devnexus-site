title: 'Unbundling of the Cloud Data Warehouse: Open Source Databases and Data Lakes'
description: "In the era of proprietary cloud data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery,
  and Redshift, data teams achieved scalability and convenience but at the cost of
  performance bottlenecks, soaring expenses, and vendor lock-in. As workloads expanded
  to include user-facing analytics, observability, and machine learning, the limitations
  of traditional monolithic architectures became apparent.\r\nThis talk examines the
  unbundling of the cloud data warehouse and the emergence of a modern data stack
  driven by open source technologies. We will discuss how databases like Postgres
  and ClickHouse, combined with open data lake standards such as Iceberg, Delta Lake,
  and Hudi, enable flexible, cost-effective, and high-performance solutions. By replacing
  traditional warehouses with composable and open architectures, organizations can
  build systems optimized for their specific real-time analytics and data processing
  needs."
