title: 'Integrating LLMs in Java: A Practical Guide to Model Context Protocol'
description: "As Large Language Models (LLMs) revolutionize application development,
  Java developers face a critical challenge: how to securely and efficiently connect
  these AI models with enterprise data and tools. The Model Context Protocol (MCP)
  offers a practical solution by providing a standardized approach for integrating
  AI capabilities into Java applications while maintaining enterprise-grade security
  and scalability.\r\n\r\nThrough live coding demonstrations, we'll explore how to
  leverage Java's MCP implementation to build powerful AI-enabled applications. Starting
  with basic setup and configuration, we'll progress to building custom MCP servers
  using Java and create practical features that combine the power of LLMs with Java's
  robust ecosystem. You'll see firsthand how to connect your Java applications to
  your favorite MCP enabled clients and other AI tools while maintaining control over
  your data and infrastructure.\r\n\r\nAttendees will leave this session with everything
  needed to start implementing MCP in their Java projects: working code examples,
  best practices for secure AI integration, patterns for building custom MCP servers,
  and practical strategies for enhancing existing applications with AI capabilities.
  Whether you're new to AI integration or looking to standardize your approach across
  the enterprise, you'll gain actionable insights to immediately improve your AI development
  workflow."
