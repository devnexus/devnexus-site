Hi, Spring fans! Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3 imply a new baseline, bringing the Spring ecosystem in line with the needs of tomorrow's workloads. A huge part of that is the new baselines of Jakarta EE and Java 17 and the new support for GraalVM native images, based on the work of Spring Native. Join me, Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long, and we'll explore the implications of this exciting new technology for your Spring Boot applications and services.
