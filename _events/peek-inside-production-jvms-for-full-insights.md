title: Peek Inside Production JVMs for Full Insights
description: "When a Java application runs in production, we often lose visibility
  into what’s actually being loaded by the JVM, and what the JVM is really doing.
  Which JARs are present? Which versions are actually on the classpath? Which Garbage
  Collector is being used? What JVM flags were set by default ergonomics and what
  is being customized?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll explore an AI-written tool for introspecting
  JVM during execution. \r\n\r\nI'll demonstrate how I wrote JLib Inspector to scan
  and analyze loaded JARs at runtime, as well as how to use similar feature in OpenTelemetry.
  And what else we can get from the JVM in production."
