title: 'Durable Execution: Building Apps That Refuse to Die'
description: Building distributed applications is hard, with challenges like retries,
  state management, and failure recovery often adding hidden complexity. Durable execution
  frameworks address these problems by persisting execution and resuming seamlessly
  after crashes, so developers can focus on business logic instead of plumbing. In
  this session, youâ€™ll see practical code examples and a live demo of how durable
  execution simplifies microservice orchestration and long-running operations, making
  resilient apps accessible to every developer.
