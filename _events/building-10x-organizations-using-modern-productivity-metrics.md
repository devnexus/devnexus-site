title: Building 10x Organizations using Modern Productivity Metrics
description: "Developer Experience is Dead! Long Live Developer Experience!\r\n\r\nIn
  this keynote-style session, we’ll take a detailed, granular look at the barriers
  to productivity developers face today and modern approaches for removing them. 10x
  developers may be a myth, but 10x organizations are very real, as proven by the
  influential study performed in the 1980s, ‘The Coding War Games.’\r\n\r\nRight now,
  here in early 2025, we seem to be experiencing YAPP (Yet Another Productivity Philosophy),
  and that philosophy is converging on developer experience. It seems that with every
  new method, we invent to deliver products, whether physical or virtual, we reinvent
  productivity philosophies to go alongside them.\r\n\r\nBut which of these approaches
  works? DORA? SPACE? DevEx? What should we invest in and create urgency behind today
  so we don’t have the same discussion again in a decade?\r\n"
