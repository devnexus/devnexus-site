title: 'I Can See Clearly Now: Observability of JVM & Spring Boot 2-3-4 apps'
description: "Are you running applications in production? Are they behaving like gremlins
  after midnight? Do your logs disappear faster than free coffee at a tech conference?\r\nWelcome
  to the world of software, where we try to make sense of the chaos without losing
  our remaining brain cells.\r\n\r\nJoin us on this example-driven journey where we
  go through how to make your new or existing Java/JVM/Spring Boot applications observable
  and explore the toolsets available for you today to instrument your application
  so that it can tell you what it is doing and why. We will explore how to instrument
  your JVM-based application without vendor lock-in using Micrometer, OpenTelemetry,
  Grafana, OpenZipkin, Prometheus, OpenMetrics, etc, so you can have a much better
  understanding of what is going on inside of your app.\r\n\r\nExpect live demos,
  questionable diagrams, and at least one picture of a cat trying to debug an HTTP
  500 error. Whether you are a seasoned observability wizard or still wondering what
  a \"span\" is, this talk will give you practical tools. Bring your questions and
  logs, we've got dashboards and emotional support."
