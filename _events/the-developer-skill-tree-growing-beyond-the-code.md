title: 'The Developer Skill Tree: Growing Beyond the Code'
description: "Being great at coding gets you in the room, but soft skills determine
  how far you grow once you’re there. In fast-paced, collaborative environments, developers
  are expected to write excellent code and navigate communication, feedback, conflict,
  and change. But we rarely get formal training on how to do that well.\r\n\r\nIn
  this talk, we’ll explore the most underrated branches of the developer skill tree,
  empathy, communication, and adaptability, and how strengthening them can level up
  your impact, your team dynamics, and your career. You’ll walk away with practical
  strategies for having better 1:1s, asking smarter questions, staying flexible when
  requirements shift, and building a reputation as someone who makes teams better,
  not just codebases.\r\n\r\nWhether you're mentoring, contributing to open source,
  or navigating your next role, this talk will give you the tools to grow in the places
  your IDE can’t see."
