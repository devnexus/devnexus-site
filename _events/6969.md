In the fall of 2020, Stephen O'Grady of RedMonk wrote about <a href="https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2020/10/06/developer-experience-gap/">The Developer Experience Gap</a>. He described how on one hand developers have access to "any infrastructure primitive they could possibly want" but on the other hand they are left with the problem of getting them to "play nicely together". This paradox resonates for any developer building solutions for the cloud today but seems even further amplified in the Kubernetes ecosystem. In this session we will explore some of the powerful open source technologies available to developers within that ecosystem but with a particular focus on closing the developer experience gap.
