title: 'Testing on Thin Ice: Chipping Away at Test Unpredictability'
description: "Ever tried to catch melting snowflakes? That's the challenge of dealing
  with flaky tests - those annoying, unpredictable tests that fail randomly and pass
  when rerun. In this talk, we'll slide down the slippery slope of why flaky tests
  are more than just a nuisance. They're time-sinks, morale crushers, and silent code
  quality killers.\r\n\r\nWe'll skate across real-life scenarios to understand how
  flaky tests can freeze your development in its tracks, and why sweeping them under
  the rug is like ignoring a crack in the ice. From delayed releases to lurking bugs,
  the stakes are high, and the costs are real.\r\n\r\nBut don't pack your parkas just
  yet! We're here to share expert strategies and insights on how to identify, analyze,
  and ultimately melt away these flaky tests. Through our combined experience, we'll
  provide actionable techniques and tools to make sure snow is the only flakiness
  you experience, ensuring a smoother, more reliable journey in software development."
