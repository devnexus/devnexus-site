title: CQRS meets modern Java
description: "Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a proven design pattern
  that enables the clear separation of data changes (commands) and data queries (queries).
  This separation allows these responsibilities to be scaled and optimized independently.
  The application code is also structured more understandably, which improves maintainability.\r\n\r\nThis
  talk will deepen our understanding of the practical implementation of the CQRS principles
  using modern Java language features such as records, sealed classes, switch expressions,
  and pattern matching. An example application will demonstrate how the theoretical
  foundations of CQRS can be applied in practice and how this affects application
  design while increasing data access efficiency."
