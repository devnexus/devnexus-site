title: 'Make Mechanical Advantage YOUR Advantage: How to modernize & futureproof your
  code with OpenRewrite'
description: "So-called simple solutions are usually the most elegant. Experts make
  difficult tasks look easy. The smartest people make complex concepts easily understood.\r\n\r\nThese
  are truisms. And while supposed exceptions can be offered, they are actually validation,
  e.g. brute-force \"kludges\" aren't simple in the context of lifecycle, and the
  _smartest_ people understand the problem, the solution, AND the audience.\r\n\r\nOur
  toolbelts now include AI, which is wonderful addition. But most problems are not
  wholly AI-shaped or are better addressed - more quickly and/or at lower cost - using
  one of the many other tools available. Or by combining one of more of them.\r\n\r\nMechanical
  Advantage refers to the use of one or more \"simple machines\" to create a force
  multiplier and accomplish great feats with little effort. Consider these basic physical
  items we see but often overlook:\r\n\r\n- Lever and fulcrum\r\n- Wheel and axle\r\n-
  Pulley\r\n- Inclined plane\r\n- Wedge\r\n- Screw\r\n\r\nEach of these tools enables
  outsized results from small efforts. Combining them amplifies outputs while further
  reducing inputs! But mechanical advantage doesn't apply only to the physical world.
  Software equivalents usually center on things such as:\r\n\r\n- Patterns\r\n- Idempotency\r\n-
  Repeatability\r\n- Consistency\r\n\r\nBy applying one of more of these concepts
  to software, quality can dramatically improve and scarce resources can be freed
  for more valuable efforts.\r\n\r\nEngineering teams face an ever-growing mound of
  outdated code and unfolding security vulnerabilities that can slow your organization's
  momentum...or stop it in its tracks.\r\n\r\nCome to this session to learn how to
  put Mechanical Advantage to work for maximum payoff with minimum effort."
