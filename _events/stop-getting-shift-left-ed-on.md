title: Stop getting "shift left'ed" on
description: "Are you tired of being \"shift left'ed on\"? You're probably buried,
  starting with having to build containers for your\r\napps, a job developers shouldn't
  be doing. It's a delicate mess of copy-pasta that puts you on the hook for\r\neverything.
  When a CVE drops, you're forced to stop coding, root around in that brittle file,
  and trigger a complete\r\nrebuild (and hopefully tests!) just to apply a simple
  patch. All that toil is why we say \"friends don't let friends build\r\ncontainers.\"
  This talk shows you how to stop getting buried in shift left and instead shift down
  container building\r\nto where it belongs: the platform. Cloud Native Buildpacks
  are the way to do it. We'll show you how they take the\r\ntoil of container management
  off your hands so you can stop building containers and get back to building\r\napplications."
