JavaFX is powerful, believe it or not and in this session I will try to share some tips and tricks that might
help you creating your own JavaFX based apps. I will cover things like styling a JavaFX app using CSS, let you know
when it makes sense to use the JavaFX Canvas node, why you really should learn how to use a vector drawing program.
