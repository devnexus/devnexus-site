title: 'Java + LLMs: A hands-on guide to building LLM Apps in Java with JakartaEE'
description: "AI is revolutionizing the software landscape. However, for many Java
  developers, integrating these powerful AI tools into existing enterprise applications
  or a new one can feel daunting. In this hands-on session, we'll demystify the process
  and show you how to build LLM-powered features directly into your Java codebase.\r\n\r\nUsing
  JakartaEE and the LangChain4j library, we'll dive deep into Retrieval Augmented
  Generation (RAG), a cutting-edge technique that combines the vast knowledge of LLMs
  with the precision of your own data. We'll explore how to create both few-shot and
  zero-shot RAG models, and then add practical features like summarization and similarity
  search, backed by an Embedding database.\r\n\r\nThrough a live coding demo, weâ€™ll
  walk you through constructing an AI-powered online store backend and provide practical
  insights into the architecture and code.\r\n\r\nWhether you're familiar with AI
  or just getting started, this session will give you the confidence and skills to
  harness the potential of LLMs in your Java projects. \r\n"
