title: 'Unveiling the Hidden Layers of Java Class Files: Beyond Bytecode'
description: In this session, we will explore the intricate details of Java class
  files beyond the commonly discussed bytecode. A key focus will be on the invokedynamic
  instruction and the attributes that enable its advanced capabilities, such as facilitating
  lambda expressions and optimizing string concatenation. We will also delve into
  the nestmates feature, which streamlines the interaction between outer and inner
  classes, enhancing both performance and flexibility in class file structure. Whether
  you are a seasoned Java developer or new to understanding the depths of the JVM,
  this session will provide valuable insights into the hidden layers of Java class
  files.
