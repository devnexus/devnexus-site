GraalVM is a high-performance virtual machine, bringing new performance optimizations for individual languages and seamless interoperability for polyglot applications. In this session we'll talk about how GraalVM enables polyglot programming, ensures high performance of multilingual applications, and allows to gradually update your applications. We'll see how see you can extend your Java application with machine learning or data science libraries from Python and R, perform server-side rendering of JavaScript on the JVM, and use other languages and libraries of your choice.
