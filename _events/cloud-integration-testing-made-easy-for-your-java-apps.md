title: Cloud Integration Testing Made Easy for Your Java Apps
description: "Integration testing is complicated as it is, even more so when third-party
  services are involved, but cloud-native AWS applications that rely on managed services
  are especially tough to test.\r\n\r\nCloud integration tests are particularly challenging
  due to the high complexity of the interconnected services, dependency management,
  deployment and provisioning intricacies, and potentially high costs. So how can
  we bring the ease and speed of unit tests into these integration tests? Ideally,
  we’d like to use a local setup where we can quickly spin up and deploy our services
  in an emulated environment that’s as close as possible to the real deal. By simulating
  real-world scenarios and testing the integration of various parts of the system,
  these tests help us identify and resolve issues early in the development process.
  This is where Testcontainers and LocalStack work beautifully together to bring you
  the best of integration tests and cloud services on your machine. We’ll explore
  how we can enhance the testability of a Spring Boot application that relies on AWS
  services and vastly increase the test coverage of our applications without any need
  for mocking or remote AWS sandbox accounts.\r\n\r\nTesting your AWS-powered Spring
  Boot app with LocalStack and Testcontainers conveys isolation, speed, cost, and
  flexibility, making it effortless to get started with writing integration tests
  for your cloud application."
