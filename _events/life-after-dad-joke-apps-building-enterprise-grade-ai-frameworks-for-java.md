title: Life after dad joke apps - building "enterprise grade" AI frameworks for Java
description: "How do we move beyond the first round of AI PoCs and build reliable,
  useful AI features for our existing apps? In\r\nthis panel, we'll move past the
  basics to tackle the hard parts of using AI in real-world applications, things like\r\ndynamic
  planning vs. static workflows, automated goal verification, and building maintainable,
  testable AI actions.\r\nAfter you've seen all the knee-slapping dad-joke demos,
  join this discussion to learn what's practical today for\r\nbuilding and managing
  AI workflows in Java. We'll also look at what to expect in the next year when it
  comes to\r\nJava AI frameworks that support \"enterprise grade\" requirements."
