title: Duke on CRaC with Jakarta EE
description: "Have you heard of Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint (CRaC)? The short
  version is that it is a super fast way to start your Java applications. Did you
  know that you can do that with Jakarta EE as well? \r\n\r\nJoin us in this session
  and follow Duke’s adventures of building modern and quick Jakarta EE applications
  with even faster start-up time. You will learn the basics of CRaC as well as gain
  an understanding of why it is a particularly good fit for Jakarta EE.\r\n"
