title: Duke on CRaC with Jakarta EE
description: "Have you heard of Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint (CRaC)? The short
  version is that it is a super fast way to start your Java applications. Did you
  know that you can do that with Jakarta EE as well? \r\n\r\nJoin us in this session
  and follow Dukeâ€™s adventures of building modern and quick Jakarta EE applications
  with even faster start-up time. You will learn the basics of CRaC as well as gain
  an understanding of why it is a particularly good fit for Jakarta EE.\r\n"
