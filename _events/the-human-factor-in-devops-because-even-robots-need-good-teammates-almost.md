title: 'The Human Factor in DevOps: Because Even Robots Need Good Teammates (Almost)'
description: "Remember when \"DevOps\" meant throwing code (and maybe a few passive-aggressive
  emails, that thankfully weren’t meetings) over the wall? We’d like to think that
  the last decade and a half has dispelled us of that notion, but has it really? Often
  when organizations begin their “DevOps Transformation” they focus so much on automation,
  but the component that is more often than not overlooked is the human element. Human
  connection. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, Jeremy will dig into some strategies for building
  teams that actually work together, and might even come to like each other (though
  he can’t promise “meetings that are emails” will become a norm). He’ll talk about
  ways to encourage open communication, resolve conflicts, and create a team culture
  where everyone feels valued - because even the best automation tools can’t replace
  a team that actually works together."
