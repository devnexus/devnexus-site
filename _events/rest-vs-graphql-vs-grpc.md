title: REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC
description: For many years REST has been the only way to implement API-endpoints.
  However in recent years, we are seeing its limitations. GraphQL and gRPC have emerged
  to address these limitations, but they are not the silver bullet, they have their
  own shortcomings. What is the best way to implement an API endpoint? We will try
  to answer these questions in this session. We will look at industry examples to
  understand the Pros/Cons of each of them. We will have a live demo where we will
  be using these API styles to interact with an actual application.
