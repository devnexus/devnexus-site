title: Introduction to Cell Architectures
description: "Modern Microservice and modulith architectures are based on the premise
  of (near) unlimited scale of the resources they are build upon. While technically
  a well architected solution can horizontally scale, sometimes you need to ask if
  you should. \r\nCell architectures provide a pattern for deliberately deploying
  multiple instances of your application, each only providing services to a subset
  of your clients, allowing you to meet non-functional requirements such as resiliency,
  availability, scalability, isolation and cost management. \r\nIn this presentation
  we will talk about the Cell architecture pattern, the benefits, downsides and ways
  to change your thinking about your application architecture as it grows."
