title: Thinking Architecturally
description: "Rich Hickey once said programmers know the benefits of everything and
  the trade offs of nothing...an approach that can lead a project down a path of frustrated
  developers and unhappy customers. As architects though, we must consider the trade
  offs of every new library, language, pattern or approach and quickly make decisions
  often with incomplete information. How should we think about the inevitable technology
  choices we have to make on a project? How do we balance competing agendas? How do
  we keep our team happy and excited without chasing every new thing that someone
  finds on the inner webs?\r\n\r\nAs architects it is our responsibility to effectively
  guide our teams on the technology journey. In this talk I will outline the importance
  of trade offs, how we can analyze new technologies and how we can effectively capture
  the inevitable architectural decisions we will make. I will also explore the value
  of fitness functions as a way of ensuring the decisions we make are actually reflected
  in the code base."
