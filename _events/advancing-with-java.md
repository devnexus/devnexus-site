title: Advancing with Java
description: "In large enterprises, Java developers do much more than write code.
  They’re also responsible for meeting company-wide standards—fixing vulnerabilities,
  upgrading frameworks and Java versions, and ensuring quality metrics like code coverage,
  technical debt, and security are in check.\r\n\r\nThese tasks, while critical, often
  compete with feature development and can slow teams down. The good news is that
  a growing set of developer-friendly tools—both open-source and commercial—can help.
  From static code analyzers to automated testing, framework migration, and vulnerability
  detection tools, developers now have powerful allies to handle routine, compliance-heavy
  tasks efficiently.\r\n\r\nThis talk explores a set of practical tools that integrate
  well into Java development workflows, helping teams ship better code faster while
  meeting organizational requirements. You’ll leave with actionable insights on boosting
  productivity, improving software quality, and making compliance a seamless part
  of the development process."
