title: Create AI-Infused Java Apps with LangChain4j
description: "Generative AI has taken the world by storm over the last year, and it
  seems like every executive leader out there is telling us “regular” Java application
  developers to “add AI” to our applications. Does that mean we need to drop everything
  we’ve built and become data scientists instead now?\r\n\r\nFortunately, we can infuse
  AI models built by actual AI experts into our applications fairly straightforwardly,
  thanks to some new projects. We promise it’s not as complicated as you might think!
  Thanks to the ease of use and superb developer experience of Quarkus and the nice
  AI integration capabilities that the LangChain4j libraries offer, it becomes trivial
  to start working with AI and make your stakeholders happy :)\r\n\r\nIn this session,
  you’ll explore a variety of AI capabilities. We’ll start from the Quarkus DevUI
  where you can try out AI models even before writing any code. Then we’ll get our
  hands dirty with some code and exploring LangChain4j features such as prompting,
  chaining, and preserving state; agents and function-calling; enriching your AI model’s
  knowledge with your documents using retrieval augmented generation (RAG); and discovering
  ways to run (and train) models locally using tools like Ollama and/or Podman AI
  Lab. In addition, we’ll look at the AI integration's observability and fault tolerance
  and compile the app to a native binary. Maybe we’ll even try some new features,
  such as generating images or audio!\r\n\r\nCome to this session to learn how to
  build AI-infused applications in Java from the actual Quarkus experts and engineers
  working on the Quarkus LangChain4j extensions. This is also an opportunity to provide
  feedback to the maintainers of these projects and contribute back to the community."
