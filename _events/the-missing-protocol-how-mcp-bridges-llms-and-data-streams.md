title: 'The Missing Protocol: How MCP Bridges LLMs and Data Streams'
description: "Nobody's talking about this: MCP isn't just another way to build chatbots.
  It's the bridge we've been missing between AI reasoning and real-time data systems.\r\nTeams
  build AI applications that work great in demos but fall apart with production data.
  Your agents analyze historical reports but can't tell what's happening in your Kafka
  streams. They're blind to schema changes and disconnected from events that matter
  to your business.\r\nInstead of treating streaming platforms like black boxes, you
  expose them directly to your agents via MCP protocol. Suddenly, your AI doesn't
  just read about data—it lives inside your data flows.\r\nLearn what becomes possible
  when you stop thinking about AI as an external service and start treating it as
  part of your streaming architecture. We'll build systems where agents subscribe
  to real-time events, reason about evolving schemas, and make decisions that ripple
  through your data platform."
