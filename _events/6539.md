Electronic exchanges have allowed global markets to become digital. At the heart of an exchange sits a "matching engine" application. Being ultimately responsible for connecting buyers and sellers, a matching engine poses difficult technical challenges around latency, high availability, fairness, determinism, auditability, stability, etc. In this presentation we will discuss the journey we traveled to build new matching engines at the Intercontinental Exchange, and how we addressed each of those concerns.
