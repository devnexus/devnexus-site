title: 'Enhancing Project Integrity: A Modernization for Bug-Free Code'
description: "Embarking on a Java project involves employing the best strategies,
  patterns, and architectural decisions, all geared towards a customer-centric.\r\n\r\nYet,
  there exists an often overlooked facet: quality assurance. While not entirely disregarded,
  we, as developers, sometimes limit ourselves to performing the basic unity and integration
  tests, which may leave room for bugs.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there are several straightforward
  approaches and tools that can be implemented to deliver a bug-free project with
  minimal effort.\r\n\r\nDuring this presentation, you'll gain practical knowledge
  of the application of the following tools and approaches:\r\n\r\n- ArchUnit: Ensuring
  consistent adherence to architectural patterns, even when multiple developers making
  changes to the project\r\n- FindBugs: Employing static analysis to proactively identify
  potential bugs in your code, effortlessly.\r\n- SonarQube: Offering a suite of diverse
  metrics and enabling the establishment of quality gates to maintain a predetermined
  standard of quality\r\n- PiTest: Enabling the power of mutation testing to uncover
  bugs that may otherwise remain concealed.\r\n- TestContainers: Streamlining the
  process of running various components such as databases, services, and extensions,
  thereby minimizing the need for manual intervention\r\n\r\nThroughout the session,
  we'll delve into concrete examples, ensuring a hands-on experience"
