title: GenAI for Supply Chain at Apple using RAG
description: "I led the end-to-end design and implementation of a Generative AI solution
  at Apple, developed using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This
  system ingests supplier audit findings and intelligently generates tailored Corrective
  Action Plans (CAPs). My role included designing the technical architecture, training
  and fine-tuning LLMs, integrating Apple’s audit standards into the system, and deploying
  the solution within Apple’s SupplierCare portal. I also built feedback loops and
  compliance review integrations to ensure high accuracy and learning over time.\r\n\r\nThis
  solution represents one of the first enterprise-scale applications of Generative
  AI specifically tailored for supply chain compliance workflows. Prior systems required
  heavy human intervention and manual documentation. By embedding a RAG-powered architecture
  that combines audit-specific retrieval with large language model reasoning, this
  project introduces a novel way to automate judgment-based compliance tasks — a space
  typically untouched by AI at scale. It is also designed to evolve into an intelligent
  audit expert, a rare implementation of self-improving GenAI in regulatory environments."
