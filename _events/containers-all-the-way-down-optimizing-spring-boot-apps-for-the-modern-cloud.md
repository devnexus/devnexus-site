title: 'Containers All the Way Down!: Optimizing Spring Boot apps for the Modern Cloud'
description: "In a cloud-native world, containerization is a key enabler for scalable,
  portable, resilient, and (cost-)effective applications! This session will explore
  how Spring Boot developers can seamlessly optimize their applications for containerized
  environments.\r\n\r\nThe presenter will discuss and demonstrate the following pivotal
  topics and more:\r\n\r\n* Best practices for building efficient, lightweight container
  images tailored for Spring Boot applications\r\n* How Spring Boot simplifies the
  creation of these images with built-in support for Docker and Cloud Native Buildpacks
  (CNB)\r\n* Leveraging Boot's built-in support for TestContainers to create integration
  tests that best simulate production, vitally important for both development and
  build pipelines\r\n* Cloud Native Buildpack support for building both traditional
  JVM-based applications and high-performance native images using GraalVM, customization
  options, and more\r\n\r\nThrough a lively discussion and live demos, you'll see
  how to optimize your development workflow and ensure that your Spring Boot applications
  can handle the demands of production in a containerized world. Come to this session
  to learn how to unlock the *full* potential of containers for your Spring Boot projects!"
