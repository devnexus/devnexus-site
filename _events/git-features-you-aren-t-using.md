title: Git features you arenâ€™t using
description: "In this session we'll take a tour of some features that you might or
  might not have heard of, but can significantly improve your workflow and day-to-day
  interaction with Git.\r\n\r\nGit continues to see improvements daily. However, work
  (and life) can take over, and we often miss the changelog. This means we don't know
  what changed, and consequently fail to see how we can incorporate those in our usage
  of Git.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will look at some features you are probably aware
  of, but haven't used, alongside new features that Git has brought to the table.
  Examples include:\r\n\r\n- Rebase and interactive rebase\r\n- `restore`/`switch`
  and when to use them\r\n- worktrees\r\n- shallow-clones\r\n-  Git's filesystem monitor\r\n\r\nBy
  the end of this session, you will walk away with a slew of new tools in your arsenal,
  and a new perspective on how this can help you and your colleagues get the most
  out of Git."
