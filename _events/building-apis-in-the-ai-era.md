title: Building APIs in the AI Era
description: How can architects and software developers use AI to transform the process
  of developing APIs? Our discussion in this session will center on how AI is revolutionizing
  software development, with an emphasis on how AI assistants can be incorporated
  into the process of creating APIs. We will look at how AI tools can improve testing,
  speed up code generation, maintain stronger security, and maximize performance.
  Through a series of demonstrations, attendees will learn how to best incorporate
  AI-driven solutions into their API projects to maximize output, reduce time-to-market,
  and maintain quality standards. Come learn how AI is a disruptive force in the evolution
  of API development, not just a small improvement.
