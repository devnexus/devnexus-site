title: 'Java Performance: Beyond Simple Request Latencies'
description: "When someone says \"Java performance,\" most Java devs hear \"request
  latency\" and a large part of them say \"I'm already meeting my SLAs\" or \"my app
  isn't latency-sensitive.\" But Java performance has many more dimensions than that,
  and they matter for all kinds of Java appsâ€”from ultra-low-latency FX trading platforms
  to long-running data ingestion jobs running at 2 AM on a Saturday.\r\n\r\nIn this
  session, we'll go beyond the basics to look at the full Java performance picture:
  median latencies, latency outliers, freezes, pauses, server max carrying capacity,
  how your app behaves when it first starts up, carbon footprint, and more. We'll
  check out the full landscape of tools at your disposal, from the newest JEPs in
  OpenJDK to GraalVM and Azul Platform Prime, and develop strategies to optimize whatever
  matters most to your team."
