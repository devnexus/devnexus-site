title: Functional Spring Boot
description: 10 years after the advent of Spring, Spring Boot shifted the paradigm
  from XML to Annotations. 10 years later, it is time to shift the paradigm again,
  this time toward functional programming. Spring Boot has been quietly adding functional
  APIs and DSLs since 2.0. These APIs deliver many benefits such as better performance
  and easier learning curve. In this talk, we will learn how to uncover these hidden
  gems in Spring Boot.
