title: Developer Productivity With IntelliJ IDEA
description: "Developer productivity is a hot topic right now, but what does it mean?
  Is it all just about squeezing more lines of code out of us poor, overworked developers?
  Or could it, in fact, lead to developer joy?\r\n\r\nIn this session, Trisha will
  show some of her favorite IntelliJ IDEA tips for improving her own productivity.
  She'll use these examples to talk about what productivity is, what it is not, and
  why it's even more important to us as developers than it is to the organizations
  that pay our salaries. And it's of course important to them, too!\r\n\r\nAttendees
  will gain a deeper understanding of how IntelliJ IDEA helps them to be effective,
  productive, and happy. Trisha wants you to look at your toolchain and ask yourself,
  “Does this enable me to be creative and happy?”"
