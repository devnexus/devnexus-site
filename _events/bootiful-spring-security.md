title: Bootiful Spring Security
description: "\"Security is hard!\" is what the person who does not attend this talk
  might rightly contend. But you are going to attend this talk, because you know that
  getting security right will be a win when it comes time to justify your attendance
  at SpringOne, and nobody, and we mean, nobody, will give you more working code to
  chew on than Spring Security lead Rob Winch and his trusty and faithful sidekick,
  Josh Long. In this session, we will look at security defaults, password management,
  authentication and authorization, one-time tokens, passkeys, OAuth (including the
  amazing Spring Authorization Server), method security, and general tips on how to
  simplify standing up and validating such projects with Testcontainers and Testjars.\r\n"
