title: 'Run to the light Carol Anne: Auditing with Lighthouse'
description: Have you heard about Lighthouse? Are you afraid to go into the light
  like Carol Anne in Poltergeist? Don't be afraid because Lighthouse is an awesome
  tool to achieve your web experience goals. You can do a bunch of awesome things
  in Lighthouse like running SEO audits, front-end performance audits, and my favorite,
  accessibility audits. This talk will explore reasons that audits and testing are
  necessary, and walk through different types of audits you can run. The end goal
  is analyzing the results and taking steps to achieve your web experience goals.
