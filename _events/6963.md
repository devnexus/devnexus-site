Spring Framework 5, Spring Boot 2, and Spring Cloud have had stable versions since 2017-2018. This year each active Spring project will have a new major release. We will talk about the practical implications of changes to the Java baseline, Jakarta EE, native compilation, observability and more. We will discuss the support options for remaining on the existing generation. We will show what upgrading an existing application looks like using the latest milestones.
