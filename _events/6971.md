Looking to gain hands-on experience with Apache Kafka and streaming pipelines but not sure where to start? Let’s build a practical streaming pipeline in the cloud! This presentation explores the process of building your own practical, end-to-end streaming solution that you can leverage in your own home to monitor and alert on the watering needs of your houseplants.

We’ll begin by walking through a simple raspberry pi-based hardware solution that streams soil moisture and temperature readings into Kafka. A ksqlDB deep-dive will show you how to join on, aggregate, and filter the data using a series of sql-like statements. We’ll then produce actionable insights on the soil readings that will determine when plants ought to be watered and send push alerts through Telegram using Kafka Connect. Throughout the presentation, you’ll hear about techniques, best practices, and, of course, some of the pain points you might encounter as you implement your own practical pipeline.

By the end of the talk, you’ll have everything you need to start building practical streaming pipelines in your own home. Roll up your sleeves — let’s get our hands dirty!
