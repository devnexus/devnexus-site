title: Software and AI in the time of Legislation.  New (and old) laws for developers
description: "The software development landscape is rapidly changing, with legislation
  emerging as a key driver of industry trends. As our reliance on software and AI
  grows, so does its vulnerability to cybercrime – now a staggering $6 trillion problem.
  This has caught the attention of regulators worldwide. \r\n\r\nThis talk examines
  the complex interplay between software, AI, and the law, with a particular focus
  on what this means for Java developers.  \r\n\r\nWe'll explore the challenges of
  securing the software supply chain, examine the reasoning behind recent legislation
  and  see how they come together. \r\n\r\nWe'll look at  practical frameworks for
  weaving compliance into development practices and  tackle both the ethical and pragmatic
  aspects of a developer's role in mitigating cyber risks. By reframing security and
  compliance not as obstacles, but as catalysts for pushing the boundaries of productivity
  and technology we can gain  insights to what is needed to thrive in an evolving
  legal environment without stifling innovation.  \r\n\r\nAI, Software, and the Law
  – more opportunity than obstacle\r\n"
