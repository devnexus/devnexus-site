title: Supercharge Your Applications with Java, Graphs, and a Touch of AI
description: We all want to use GenAI to give ourselves superpowers, right? It’s fun
  to imagine and build innovative applications, but what does it take to move beyond
  simple examples? In this session, the presenters will build a RAG application using
  Quarkus and Neo4j, highlighting the differences from a traditional, non-AI approach.
  We’ll explore how Quarkus leverages familiar Java development patterns while supporting
  the performance and efficiency needed for AI workloads. Along the way, we’ll discuss
  design considerations, common challenges, and developer-friendly features that simplify
  building smarter apps. From concepts to coding, join us to learn how to take your
  Java applications to the next level.
