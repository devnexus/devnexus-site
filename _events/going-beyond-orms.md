title: Going beyond ORMs
description: For some time now JSON has been the preferred format for exchanging data
  between client (browsers) and servers. Often times developers had to configure data
  marshalling options to transform data into business objects, into persistent data,
  and back again. Perhaps it would make more sense to use JSON across the business
  pipeline without sacrificing performance nor missing benefits from the relational
  data world. this is what JSON Duality Views propose. In this session we'll explore
  options to enhance data driven applications written with Spring Boot, Quarkus, and
  Micronaut, enhancing your developer experience and increasing customer satisfaction.
