description: " As a tech lead, you will be faced with shifting requirements, tight
  timelines and unexpected complexities while bridging the gap between business goals
  and engineering realities. But your primary concern should be keeping your team
  motivated and performing at a high level without drifting into burnout.\r\n\r\nFortunately,
  there already are many established software development patterns and practices designed
  to help teams develop quality products efficiently. Additionally new tools are constantly
  hitting the market, each promising faster and cheaper delivery. How do you find
  the strategies that work for your team?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Sujith will share lessons
  from years of experience in software delivery both as a creator and a consumer of
  business value. He will walk through a practical rubric he uses to choose the appropriate
  processes, practices, and tools for specific situations. You will learn how to apply
  this approach yourself - so you can build a framework that empowers your team and
  drives lasting stakeholder satisfaction."
