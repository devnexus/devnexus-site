title: Let OpenID Connect secure your applications
description: "Implementing the correct security patterns is a common challenge that
  most application developers and consultants can get wrong in even the most common
  of scenarios. Reinventing the wheel is a common pattern that DevOps engineers do
  when integrating security solutions inside their applications (authentication, password
  validation, identity management, correct storage of user data, etc.).\r\nOpenID
  Connect is an open security standard that can be used to solve most of these concerns
  in a reliable and scalable way for modern cloud applications, in a way that most
  developers are unaware of!\r\n\r\nThis talk will focus on the benefits of securing
  an enterprise application using OpenID Connect concepts with multiple Java Framworks,
  with a live demonstration of a small application that uses standard frameworks (Jakarta
  EE and Eclipse MicroProfile) in tandem with an external OpenID Connect provider."
