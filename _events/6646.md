Yes, I want to build my Java applications with MicroProfile and Jakarta EE. Then, do I have to build everything from scratch? Are there tools that will make coding my application easier (in 2022)? Join us as we answer these questions, demonstrate the tools in action, and talk about what may be coming next.

MicroProfile seeks to optimize enterprise Java for microservices architecture and its APIs are gaining momentum and popularity. Jakarta EE is an open set of APIs that enables the worldwide community of Java developers to build applications for enterprises. Both MicroProfile and Jakarta EE are often used together to develop cloud-native Java applications. Then, are tools available for developers to easily build applications with MicroProfile and Jakarta EE?

In this session, we will examine the tools that are available to make your life easier as you code MicroProfile and Jakarta EE-based applications for cloud. These tools help developers throughout the development lifecycle, from creating a new application, working with compatible runtimes and your favourite editor, to testing your application. Join us to learn about what's out there, talk about what's coming, and see these tools in action.
