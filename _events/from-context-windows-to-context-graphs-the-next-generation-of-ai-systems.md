title: 'From Context Windows to Context Graphs: The Next Generation of AI Systems'
description: "Abstract\r\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have captured everyone’s imagination—but
  under the hood, they’re limited by a simple fact: they can only “remember” what
  fits into a context window. That’s why they sometimes forget, contradict themselves,
  or fail to connect the dots across conversations. In enterprise settings, these
  failures aren’t just quirks—they’re risks to adoption, reliability, and ROI.\r\nThis
  talk explores the evolution of AI memory and reasoning:\r\n• RAG (Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation): fetching external knowledge when the model doesn’t know enough.\r\n•
  CAG (Context-Augmented Generation): enriching answers with curated, structured context
  for higher accuracy.\r\n• Context Graphs: a breakthrough that gives AI something
  closer to long-term memory, explainability, and reasoning.\r\nWe’ll also show how
  agentic AI design patterns—like Planner-Executor, Critic-Actor, and Memory-Augmented
  Agents—become powerful when combined with these advances.\r\n\r\nWhy this talk matters
  (Strategic ROI)\r\n• Reduce wasted cycles: Minimize hallucinations and rework, lowering
  the cost of errors.\r\n• Increase productivity: Agents with reliable memory scale
  beyond demos to handle real workflows.\r\n• Build trust & adoption: Explainable
  AI reduces resistance from compliance, risk, and business stakeholders.\r\n• Future-proof
  investment: Context graphs evolve with data, ensuring long-term adaptability.\r\n\r\nWho
  should attend\r\n• AI newcomers curious why models forget and how memory can be
  extended.\r\n• Engineers seeking practical design patterns to build production-ready
  AI.\r\n• Leaders looking to understand how better AI memory drives ROI and enterprise
  readiness.\r\n\r\nKey takeaway\r\nAI is moving beyond prompts and short-term context.
  By the end of this session, you’ll see how the field is evolving—from context windows
  → RAG → CAG → context graphs—and why this evolution is not just a technical leap,
  but a strategic one, enabling reliable, scalable, and ROI-driven Generative + Agentic
  AI systems."
