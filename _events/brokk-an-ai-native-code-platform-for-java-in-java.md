title: 'Brokk: an AI-Native Code Platform for Java, in Java'
description: "Brokk is a new tool written with Java Swing for supervising code-writing
  AI assistants.\r\n\r\nIt is a standalone application because effective context engineering
  for software development requires a different paradigm than the 40 year old IDE
  design optimized for reading and writing code at human speeds.\r\n\r\nThis talk
  will cover the principles behind Brokk's design, how Brokk leverages static analysis
  to help LLMs understand your code at a level deeper than raw text, and Java-specific
  optimizations like dependency decompilation to avoid hallucinations.\r\n\r\nWe'll
  also take a brief look at the JVM tech powering Brokk, including Eclipse JDT (the
  static analysis engine) and Jlama (pure Java LLM inference).\r\n"
