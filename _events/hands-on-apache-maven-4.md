description: "Frustrated with Apache Maven? Confused about how to control versions
  in multi-modules? Annoyed at how much of your build information is published to
  a maven repository when you publish your artifacts? Curious about Apache Maven?\r\n\r\nThis
  session is for you! Slides are great to share theory, how about live coding? In
  this session, together, we will  pick up difficult use cases that most of us encounter
  when managing our maven projects for build and deployment, especially with multiple
  modules. \r\n\r\nApache Maven 4 is a great improvement over previous versions and

  Maven!"
