title: Fundamentals of Software Engineering In the age of AI
description: "Agentic coding assistants and editor based AI chat interfaces are altering
  the development workflow leading some to proclaim the end of software engineering.
  Is it time to explore other careers? Not so fast, the rumors of our demise are greatly
  exaggerated! While these tools can boost productivity, to be used effectively, developers
  still need to master the fundamentals of the software craft. Modern software development
  demands more than just coding proficiencyâ€”it requires navigating an increasingly
  AI-augmented landscape. This intensive workshop bridges the critical gap between
  what early-career developers learn in formal education and what they need to thrive
  in professional environments where human expertise and artificial intelligence increasingly
  collaborate. Based on our book \"Fundamentals of Software Engineering,\" we guide
  participants through a comprehensive journey from programmer to well-rounded software
  engineer equipped to leverage AI tools effectively while maintaining engineering
  fundamentals.\r\n\r\nParticipants will develop both technical capabilities and professional
  skills that remain relevant regardless of changing languages, frameworks, and AI
  capabilities. Through a balanced mix of conceptual teaching, collaborative discussions,
  and hands-on exercises with both traditional and AI-assisted approaches, attendees
  will work on realistic scenarios that reinforce practical application of these fundamental
  principles while developing discernment about when and how to integrate AI tools
  into their workflow."
