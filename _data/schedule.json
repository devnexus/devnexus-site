            "description": "Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a design principle in which the flow of a system’s operations is driven by the occurrence of events, rather than direct communication between services or components. There are many reasons why EDA is a standard architecture for many moderate to large companies. It offers a history of events with the ability to rewind and perform real-time data processing in a scalable and fault-tolerant way. It provides real-time extract, transform, load (ETL) capabilities for near-instantaneous processing. EDA can be used as the communication channel in microservice architectures or with any other architecture.\r\n\r\nWorkshop Requirements:\r\nGithub account\r\n\r\nWorkshop Learnings:\r\n* Key Concepts of Event-Driven Architecture\r\n* Event Sourcing\r\n* Event Streaming\r\n* Multi-tenant Event-Driven Systems\r\n* Producers, Consumers\r\n* Microservice Boundaries\r\n* Stream vs. Table\r\n* Event Notification\r\n* Event Carried State Transfer\r\n* Domain Events\r\n* Tying EDA to Domain Driven Design\r\n* Materialized Views\r\n* Outbox Pattern\r\n* CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)\r\n* Saga Pattern (Choreography and Orchestrator)\r\n* Avoiding Coupling\r\n* Monitoring Systems\r\n* Cloud-Based EDA\r\n\r\nWe will do plenty of labs during the workshop for a hands-on experience.\r\n\r\nWorkshop Benefits:\r\nThis is for architects and developers who want to learn how to develop EDA systems. Since this workshop is hands-on, you will get a tactical understanding of how to roll out your systems. This workshop is also visual, with plenty of diagrams and animations to reinforce your learning experience.\r\n\r\nWorkshop Who Should Attend:\r\nArchitects, Developers, Data Engineers",

When you can more easily secure, upgrade, move, or modernize your code, that means you can adapt quickly and efficiently to changes in technology and markets. That’s what Migration Engineering is all about, which we’ll be exploring in this workshop.\r\n\r\nWe’ll discuss and demonstrate how to write custom recipes using OpenRewrite, an open source auto-refactoring tool that enables large-scale code analysis and transformations for your teams. You’ll learn the composition of recipes as we walk through a number of examples, then we’ll demonstrate how to write custom recipes using OpenRewrite.

            "description": "Agentic coding assistants and editor based AI chat interfaces are altering the development workflow leading some to proclaim the end of software engineering. Is it time to explore other careers? Not so fast, the rumors of our demise are greatly exaggerated! While these tools can boost productivity, to be used effectively, developers still need to master the fundamentals of the software craft. Modern software development demands more than just coding proficiency—it requires navigating an increasingly AI-augmented landscape. This intensive workshop bridges the critical gap between what early-career developers learn in formal education and what they need to thrive in professional environments where human expertise and artificial intelligence increasingly collaborate. Based on our book \"Fundamentals of Software Engineering,\" we guide participants through a comprehensive journey from programmer to well-rounded software engineer equipped to leverage AI tools effectively while maintaining engineering fundamentals.\r\n\r\nParticipants will develop both technical capabilities and professional skills that remain relevant regardless of changing languages, frameworks, and AI capabilities. Through a balanced mix of conceptual teaching, collaborative discussions, and hands-on exercises with both traditional and AI-assisted approaches, attendees will work on realistic scenarios that reinforce practical application of these fundamental principles while developing discernment about when and how to integrate AI tools into their workflow.",

              "description": "Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a design principle in which the flow of a system’s operations is driven by the occurrence of events, rather than direct communication between services or components. There are many reasons why EDA is a standard architecture for many moderate to large companies. It offers a history of events with the ability to rewind and perform real-time data processing in a scalable and fault-tolerant way. It provides real-time extract, transform, load (ETL) capabilities for near-instantaneous processing. EDA can be used as the communication channel in microservice architectures or with any other architecture.\r\n\r\nWorkshop Requirements:\r\nGithub account\r\n\r\nWorkshop Learnings:\r\n* Key Concepts of Event-Driven Architecture\r\n* Event Sourcing\r\n* Event Streaming\r\n* Multi-tenant Event-Driven Systems\r\n* Producers, Consumers\r\n* Microservice Boundaries\r\n* Stream vs. Table\r\n* Event Notification\r\n* Event Carried State Transfer\r\n* Domain Events\r\n* Tying EDA to Domain Driven Design\r\n* Materialized Views\r\n* Outbox Pattern\r\n* CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)\r\n* Saga Pattern (Choreography and Orchestrator)\r\n* Avoiding Coupling\r\n* Monitoring Systems\r\n* Cloud-Based EDA\r\n\r\nWe will do plenty of labs during the workshop for a hands-on experience.\r\n\r\nWorkshop Benefits:\r\nThis is for architects and developers who want to learn how to develop EDA systems.

When you can more easily secure, upgrade, move, or modernize your code, that means you can adapt quickly and efficiently to changes in technology and markets. That’s what Migration Engineering is all about, which we’ll be exploring in this workshop.\r\n\r\nWe’ll discuss and demonstrate how to write custom recipes using OpenRewrite, an open source auto-refactoring tool that enables large-scale code analysis and transformations for your teams. You’ll learn the composition of recipes as we walk through a number of examples, then we’ll demonstrate how to write custom recipes using OpenRewrite. We will assemble these recipes with the visitor pattern, and show how to stitch recipes together with YAML, with Refaster-style templates, with Semgrep matchers, and more. We’ll also show how Generative AI can be applied to accelerate recipe development. \r\n\r\nThis is a comprehensive look at all kinds of recipe development that will enable you to come away fully equipped to plan and exercise large-scale code transformations in your organization.\r\n\r\nOutline\r\n\r\n* What is Migration Engineering?

Is it time to explore other careers? Not so fast, the rumors of our demise are greatly exaggerated! While these tools can boost productivity, to be used effectively, developers still need to master the fundamentals of the software craft. Modern software development demands more than just coding proficiency—it requires navigating an increasingly AI-augmented landscape. This intensive workshop bridges the critical gap between what early-career developers learn in formal education and what they need to thrive in professional environments where human expertise and artificial intelligence increasingly collaborate. Based on our book \"Fundamentals of Software Engineering,\" we guide participants through a comprehensive journey from programmer to well-rounded software engineer equipped to leverage AI tools effectively while maintaining engineering fundamentals.\r\n\r\nParticipants will develop both technical capabilities and professional skills that remain relevant regardless of changing languages, frameworks, and AI capabilities. Through a balanced mix of conceptual teaching, collaborative discussions, and hands-on exercises with both traditional and AI-assisted approaches, attendees will work on realistic scenarios that reinforce practical application of these fundamental principles while developing discernment about when and how to integrate AI tools into their workflow.",

            "description": "Enterprise AI is failing. The majority of enterprise Gen AI initiatives stall or fail to deliver expected value. Why? Because too many organizations have been treating AI as something alien to their existing systems, to be built by separate teams, using tools designed by people who don't understand or care about their requirements.\r\n\r\nIt's time for a course correction, bringing the Java community's proven application development skills to bear. The JVM runs many of the world's critical applications, and is ideally placed to AI enable them.\r\n\r\nIn this keynote, Rod Johnson will outline approaches for building agentic applications that work in production. These patterns share common themes: integration with what already works, structure where possible in place of text, and leveraging patterns and practices that work, like DDD and unit testing.\r\n\r\nRod will discuss topics including:\r\n\r\n- Structured Agent Interactions: Moving beyond strings to type-safe, testable agent code\r\n- Domain-anchored Agents: Why your existing domain model is your greatest AI asset, not an obstacle to work around. DICE (Domain Integrated Context Engineering) is the missing piece of context engineering\r\n- The superpower of tool methods on domain objects: Minimizing context, maximizing precision, and keeping sensitive data out of LLM calls\r\n- Agentic RAG: Combining retrieval with domain intelligence for applications that reason over business data and link customer interactions with existing entities.\r\n\r\nJava developers are uniquely positioned to turn the failure of enterprise Gen AI into success. The patterns and infrastructure we've built and modern Java frameworks facilitate are exactly what enterprise AI needs to succeed. The Embabel agent framework demonstrates that, far from playing catchup, the JVM can leapfrog other platforms.\r\n\r\nThe Python-first era of AI agents was a prototype phase. Production belongs to the JVM. Spring made enterprise Java work in the 2000s and can underpin making enterprise AI work in the 2020s.",

Developers lack ownership and understanding of the tools they use, leading to inefficiencies and a disconnect between tools and the actual team needs. Organizations are creating technicians who can follow patterns but not engineers capable of solving complex, evolving problems. \r\n\r\nShifting the focus to developing engineers who solve their own problems, select appropriate tools, and create tailored design patterns will drive innovation and adaptability, accelerating progress.",

Experienced software developers have seen one too many monoliths devolve into a big ball of mud, leaving everyone frustrated, with an itch to do a \"rewrite\". But monoliths have their pros! They are usually simpler, easier to understand, and faster to build and debug. \r\n\r\nOn the other side of the spectrum you have microservices—that offer scale, both technically and organizationally, as well as having the badge of honor of being \"the new cool kid on the block\". But productionizing microservies is HARD. \r\n\r\nWhy can't we have our cake and eat it too? Turns out, we can. In this session we will explore the modular monolith—all the upsides of a monolith with none of the downsides of distributed architectures. We'll see what it means to build a modular monolith, and how that differs from a traditional layered architecture. We will discuss how we can build architectural governance to ensure our modules remain decoupled. Finally we'll see how our modules can communicate with one another without violating modularity. \r\n\r\nBy the end of this session you'll walk away with a greater appreciation for the monolith, and see how you can leverage this within your system architecture.

As workloads expanded to include user-facing analytics, observability, and machine learning, the limitations of traditional monolithic architectures became apparent.\r\nThis talk examines the unbundling of the cloud data warehouse and the emergence of a modern data stack driven by open source technologies. We will discuss how databases like Postgres and ClickHouse, combined with open data lake standards such as Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Hudi, enable flexible, cost-effective, and high-performance solutions. By replacing traditional warehouses with composable and open architectures, organizations can build systems optimized for their specific real-time analytics and data processing needs.",

But your manager and the senior executives in your company are mentioning “AI” seemingly at every meeting.  And you’re watching unsettling YouTube posts about how GenAI will take your job or that 90% of all AI projects fail.  Pretty scary, right?\r\n\r\nIn this session, I will fast-track you through AI/ML focused on Java developers who need to get the job done without the need to drill down into data science and complicated math. \r\nThis presentation is designed for junior and intermediate Java developers who need to understand how non-deterministic tools can be effectively utilized throughout the software development process. You will gain a practical introduction to AI and Machine Learning with a focus on the Java ecosystem, featuring hands-on coding using LangChain4j, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other APIs. \r\n\r\nThis session will cover how neural networks and large language models (LLMs) process information, how to craft effective prompts and manage context, and how to use embeddings and vector databases to support Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for helpful responses. We will explore reusable prompt templates, the building blocks of chatbot architectures, and provide a brief introduction to agents, all while learning how to integrate GenAI in an ethical and responsible manner and manage potential risks. \r\n\r\nBy the end of this presentation, you should understand the very essence of AI/ML, so that you will understand what AI is and how to use it for successful deployments properly.  \r\n",

            "description": "The rise of Agentic AI is introducing a paradigm shift in the microservices architecture: services are becoming autonomous agents that can redefine their own boundaries, merge capabilities with other services, or split responsibilities based on learned optimization patterns. That is why microservices are no longer passive components but autonomous actors with their own architectural opinions and the ability to act on them.\r\nIn addition, traditional architectural patterns break when services become goal-seeking agents. Unexpected coupling emerges, contracts drift autonomously, data consistency becomes unpredictable, and governance blind spots multiply. Therefore, we need new patterns that let agents optimize while preserving system correctness.\r\n\r\nThis session tackles the fundamental challenge every architect will face in 2026: How do you maintain architectural integrity, ensure system reliability, and validate correctness when your services are autonomous actors that can redesign themselves?\r\n\r\nIn this session you will learn a taxonomy of agent-driven boundary changes with concrete examples, architectural patterns that preserve integrity while enabling autonomous evolution and testing methodologies specifically designed for non-deterministic and self-modifying systems. \r\n",

The stuff that doesn't make it into the case studies. We'll talk about the most common grievances that disrupt a developer’s flow, from dealing with overly confident wrong answers to figuring out how to prompt for a useful solution.\r\n\r\nYou know that study showing developers take 19% longer to complete tasks with AI? Yeah, we'll talk about that too. Along with the productivity theater, the metrics that make no sense, and why \"seamless integration\" is apparently developer speak for \"good luck with that.\"\r\n\r\nWhether you're a developer drowning in AI mandates, a team lead trying to make sense of it all, or an engineering manager caught between executive enthusiasm and developer eye-rolls, come ready for validation, practical strategies, and maybe a few laughs about our collective journey into the AI-powered future.",

You’ll see where orchestration pays off, where it gets messy, and what it suggests about the future of applied multi-agent AI.",

This talk lays out a practical architecture playbook: move from request/response thinking to event-driven flows; use sagas/outbox for correctness; enforce circuit breakers/bulkheads for blast-radius control; shape service boundaries around domains and agent tasks; and wire in tracing, versioning, and deprecation for long-lived agents. You’ll leave with patterns, guardrails, and KPIs to integrate agents without breaking prod.\r\n\r\nWhat is Agentic AI in Microservices\r\n\r\nAgents plan, retry, chain services → need deterministic, idempotent APIs.\r\nServices must be tool-callable (stable operationId, strict schemas).\r\nSystems must survive retry storms + fan-out.\r\nWhy Monoliths & Non-Event Systems Fail\r\n\r\nLatency and tight coupling collapse under agent retries.\r\nNo event history → agents can’t re-plan.\r\nFailures amplify without bulkheads/circuit breakers.\r\nOps teams can’t see human vs agent traffic.\r\nCore Patterns for Agent-Friendly Systems\r\n\r\nEvent-driven flows: decouple, replay-safe.\r\nSaga/outbox: long workflows with compensations, reliable events.\r\nCircuit breakers/bulkheads: contain failure, reduce blast radius.\r\nService mesh/sidecars: centralize retries, telemetry, policies.\r\nDesigning Service Boundaries\r\n\r\nBoundaries around tasks/domains (Orders, Claims, Appointments).\r\nExpose task APIs (ReserveInventory, ScheduleAppointment).\r\nResponses = reason codes + next actions, not just raw data.\r\nAvoid polymorphism; keep contracts predictable.\r\nIntegrating Agent Frameworks\r\n\r\nTool calling: operationId as tool name; strict inputs/outputs.\r\nSupervisor/planner patterns: policy checks between steps.\r\nAsync jobs: job IDs, progress endpoints, webhooks.\r\nSafety: least privilege, quotas, payload validation.\r\nInfrastructure & Operations\r\n\r\nObservability: OpenTelemetry, x-agent-run-id, dashboards for retries & success rates.\r\nVersioning: SemVer, multi-version routing, Deprecation/Sunset headers.\r\nResilience: autoscale on retry rate; degrade to read-only mode; run failover drills.\r\nTakeaways\r\n\r\nDesign APIs for determinism, idempotency, and tool-callability.\r\nUse event-driven + saga/outbox for consistency.\r\nContain failures with circuit breakers, bulkheads, and meshes.\r\nMake service boundaries task-focused for agent workflows.\r\nSeparate and monitor agent vs human traffic.\r\nBuild lifecycle discipline: versioning, deprecation, multi-version gateways.",

Today, AI agents also need memory to be useful and reliable. They need to recall past events, connect knowledge, retrieve information quickly, and even forget the right things.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will look at the history of human memory and see what lessons it offers for AI. We will explore different types of memory:\r\n\r\n- Episodic memory for storing events and experiences\r\n- Semantic memory for facts and knowledge\r\n- Working memory for short-term reasoning\r\n- Vector or embedding memory for fast retrieval across large contexts\r\n\r\nWe will then see how each of these can be implemented in AI agents, what challenges arise, and what trade-offs we need to consider. The goal is to give you both inspiration from human history and concrete tools for building better agents with memory.",

We'll check out the full landscape of tools at your disposal, from the newest JEPs in OpenJDK to GraalVM and Azul Platform Prime, and develop strategies to optimize whatever matters most to your team.",

Which JARs are present? Which versions are actually on the classpath? Which Garbage Collector is being used? What JVM flags were set by default ergonomics and what is being customized?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll explore an AI-written tool for introspecting JVM during execution. \r\n\r\nI'll demonstrate how I wrote JLib Inspector to scan and analyze loaded JARs at runtime, as well as how to use similar feature in OpenTelemetry. And what else we can get from the JVM in production.",

            "description": "AI coding agents have matured to the point that they need to be seriously considered for enterprise Java development and general SDLC tasks. CLI Tools like Claude Code, Google’s Gemini CLI, Amazon Q Developer, and OpenAI’s assistants are examples from leading large AI labs, but there are also smaller startups and open-source options. These agentic coding tools can reason about architecture, grok large code bases, and hold great promise to help developers ship software faster. They are often used in a “human in the loop” style, but they can also be instructed to execute autonomously until they determine the goal has been completed.\r\n\r\nThis talk introduces Spring AI Agents.  It provides a lightweight but powerful portable abstraction: the AgentClient. It acts as a consistent interface for invoking autonomous CLI-based agents. This allows developers to use the agentic tools they already have while providing flexibility to avoid locking into one single provider.   It also introduces Spring AI Bench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents on goal-directed enterprise-workflows.  It evaluates how effectively different agents have completed their goals and can be considered the test harness that runs any agent via Spring AI Agents.\r\n\r\nThese autonomous tools represent a significant opportunity to offload routine, but complex, development tasks, allowing developers to focus on higher-level architecture decisions, creative problem-solving, and strategic technical leadership. May the best agent win!",

            "description": "Even if Java was originally meant for clients, it soon turned out that it was a great fit for the server side as well. \r\nJ2EE came along and conquered this segment. Enterprise Java still powers the world with Spring as the dominant player.\r\n\r\nSo, what about Jakarta EE then? Most of the industry were affected in some way or the other by the namespace change from `javax.*` to `jakarta.*` in Jakarta EE 9, so there clearly are a lot of dependencies on the various Jakarta EE specifications.\r\n\r\nSpring is no exception. The framework builds on a surprisingly large set of Jakarta EE APIs and implementations. This means that it is a great advantage for a Spring developer to be aware of what is going on with the development of Jakarta EE.\r\n\r\nCome to this session to learn about the planned changes to the technologies that Spring depends on. There will be demos, and even some AI involved.",

In this age of AI and other powerful tools why should a developer take the time to learn manual refactoring? Or even plan and execute their own novel refactorings? \r\n\r\nThis talk will delve into these questions with humor and the introduction of a novel refactoring. The new refactoring allows the developer to change the return type of a method without breaking the code even when the method is used many places.\r\n\r\nThe audience for this session are software developers and the people that interface with them (product owners, scrum masters, development managers) who need to know the value of this important and often neglected technical practice.\r\n \r\nAt the end of the session, the attendee will be able to identify hidden patterns in their code bases, plan a refactor effort on legacy codebases, write their own refactorings, and know when to use AI or other tools to perform the refactoring.\r\n",

Those processes describe the delivery flow, the ability to go from requirements to working software and all of the SDLC steps in between. However, with the advent of LLMs now auto generating code, we have a maintenance issue wherein the knowledge of that code, the true usage of it and the optional semantic sugar sprinkled in becomes difficult to identify as time goes on. This gets greatly accelerated when the experience of the developer is simply not there. We always knew about Technical Debt, but are we prepared for the exponential rise in it as we embrace AI? Lean advocates for waste reduction, for a focus on standards, simplicity and the concept of value being added. This is a practice that software engineers simply have not been exposed to both in terms of how we write our code and how we protect our code equally.",

However, work (and life) can take over, and we often miss the changelog. This means we don't know what changed, and consequently fail to see how we can incorporate those in our usage of Git.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will look at some features you are probably aware of, but haven't used, alongside new features that Git has brought to the table. Examples include:\r\n\r\n- Rebase and interactive rebase\r\n- `restore`/`switch` and when to use them\r\n- worktrees\r\n- shallow-clones\r\n-  Git's filesystem monitor\r\n\r\nBy the end of this session, you will walk away with a slew of new tools in your arsenal, and a new perspective on how this can help you and your colleagues get the most out of Git.",

            "description": "Keeping enterprise Java applications secure and up-to-date is critical but traditional runtime upgrades often come with painful migrations, broken dependencies, and retesting cycles. What if you could upgrade your runtime without touching your code?​\r\nIn this session, we’ll explore the concept of zero migration — a runtime model that allows Java applications to stay current with the latest patches and features without requiring code or configuration changes. You’ll learn how this approach works in practice, why it’s a game-changer for regulated and mission-critical workloads, and how it fits into modern CI/CD and GitOps workflows. We’ll walk through real-world examples using modern runtimes like Liberty, and show how zero migration helps teams move faster, stay secure, and reduce technical debt.",

            "description": "Being great at coding gets you in the room, but soft skills determine how far you grow once you’re there. In fast-paced, collaborative environments, developers are expected to write excellent code and navigate communication, feedback, conflict, and change. But we rarely get formal training on how to do that well.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll explore the most underrated branches of the developer skill tree, empathy, communication, and adaptability, and how strengthening them can level up your impact, your team dynamics, and your career. You’ll walk away with practical strategies for having better 1:1s, asking smarter questions, staying flexible when requirements shift, and building a reputation as someone who makes teams better, not just codebases.\r\n\r\nWhether you're mentoring, contributing to open source, or navigating your next role, this talk will give you the tools to grow in the places your IDE can’t see.",

              "description": "Enterprise AI is failing. The majority of enterprise Gen AI initiatives stall or fail to deliver expected value. Why? Because too many organizations have been treating AI as something alien to their existing systems, to be built by separate teams, using tools designed by people who don't understand or care about their requirements.\r\n\r\nIt's time for a course correction, bringing the Java community's proven application development skills to bear. The JVM runs many of the world's critical applications, and is ideally placed to AI enable them.\r\n\r\nIn this keynote, Rod Johnson will outline approaches for building agentic applications that work in production. These patterns share common themes: integration with what already works, structure where possible in place of text, and leveraging patterns and practices that work, like DDD and unit testing.\r\n\r\nRod will discuss topics including:\r\n\r\n- Structured Agent Interactions: Moving beyond strings to type-safe, testable agent code\r\n- Domain-anchored Agents: Why your existing domain model is your greatest AI asset, not an obstacle to work around. DICE (Domain Integrated Context Engineering) is the missing piece of context engineering\r\n- The superpower of tool methods on domain objects: Minimizing context, maximizing precision, and keeping sensitive data out of LLM calls\r\n- Agentic RAG: Combining retrieval with domain intelligence for applications that reason over business data and link customer interactions with existing entities.\r\n\r\nJava developers are uniquely positioned to turn the failure of enterprise Gen AI into success. The patterns and infrastructure we've built and modern Java frameworks facilitate are exactly what enterprise AI needs to succeed. The Embabel agent framework demonstrates that, far from playing catchup, the JVM can leapfrog other platforms.\r\n\r\nThe Python-first era of AI agents was a prototype phase. Production belongs to the JVM. Spring made enterprise Java work in the 2000s and can underpin making enterprise AI work in the 2020s.",

              "description": "Organizations often focus on building software \"technicians\" instead of \"engineers.\" By using Platform or \"Enablement\" teams to create tools for developers, they impose standardized solutions that may not address the needs or challenges of teams most impacted.\r\n\r\nThis approach stifles critical thinking and problem-solving. Developers lack ownership and understanding of the tools they use, leading to inefficiencies and a disconnect between tools and the actual team needs. Organizations are creating technicians who can follow patterns but not engineers capable of solving complex, evolving problems. \r\n\r\nShifting the focus to developing engineers who solve their own problems, select appropriate tools, and create tailored design patterns will drive innovation and adaptability, accelerating progress.",

But your manager and the senior executives in your company are mentioning “AI” seemingly at every meeting.  And you’re watching unsettling YouTube posts about how GenAI will take your job or that 90% of all AI projects fail.  Pretty scary, right?\r\n\r\nIn this session, I will fast-track you through AI/ML focused on Java developers who need to get the job done without the need to drill down into data science and complicated math. \r\nThis presentation is designed for junior and intermediate Java developers who need to understand how non-deterministic tools can be effectively utilized throughout the software development process. You will gain a practical introduction to AI and Machine Learning with a focus on the Java ecosystem, featuring hands-on coding using LangChain4j, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other APIs. \r\n\r\nThis session will cover how neural networks and large language models (LLMs) process information, how to craft effective prompts and manage context, and how to use embeddings and vector databases to support Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for helpful responses. We will explore reusable prompt templates, the building blocks of chatbot architectures, and provide a brief introduction to agents, all while learning how to integrate GenAI in an ethical and responsible manner and manage potential risks. \r\n\r\nBy the end of this presentation, you should understand the very essence of AI/ML, so that you will understand what AI is and how to use it for successful deployments properly.  \r\n",

In this age of AI and other powerful tools why should a developer take the time to learn manual refactoring? Or even plan and execute their own novel refactorings? \r\n\r\nThis talk will delve into these questions with humor and the introduction of a novel refactoring. The new refactoring allows the developer to change the return type of a method without breaking the code even when the method is used many places.\r\n\r\nThe audience for this session are software developers and the people that interface with them (product owners, scrum masters, development managers) who need to know the value of this important and often neglected technical practice.\r\n \r\nAt the end of the session, the attendee will be able to identify hidden patterns in their code bases, plan a refactor effort on legacy codebases, write their own refactorings, and know when to use AI or other tools to perform the refactoring.\r\n",

What if you could upgrade your runtime without touching your code?​\r\nIn this session, we’ll explore the concept of zero migration — a runtime model that allows Java applications to stay current with the latest patches and features without requiring code or configuration changes. You’ll learn how this approach works in practice, why it’s a game-changer for regulated and mission-critical workloads, and how it fits into modern CI/CD and GitOps workflows. We’ll walk through real-world examples using modern runtimes like Liberty, and show how zero migration helps teams move faster, stay secure, and reduce technical debt.",

Hint: It was Prometheus!\r\n\r\nWhat you’ll learn in this session is a straightforward way to build your own local “AI Agent” using open source technologies to interact with various API’s and tools. We’ll take a look at the most common MCP Servers that developers are using today, think Git, Databases, Dev Tools, and more.

              "description": "The rise of Agentic AI is introducing a paradigm shift in the microservices architecture: services are becoming autonomous agents that can redefine their own boundaries, merge capabilities with other services, or split responsibilities based on learned optimization patterns. That is why microservices are no longer passive components but autonomous actors with their own architectural opinions and the ability to act on them.\r\nIn addition, traditional architectural patterns break when services become goal-seeking agents. Unexpected coupling emerges, contracts drift autonomously, data consistency becomes unpredictable, and governance blind spots multiply. Therefore, we need new patterns that let agents optimize while preserving system correctness.\r\n\r\nThis session tackles the fundamental challenge every architect will face in 2026: How do you maintain architectural integrity, ensure system reliability, and validate correctness when your services are autonomous actors that can redesign themselves?\r\n\r\nIn this session you will learn a taxonomy of agent-driven boundary changes with concrete examples, architectural patterns that preserve integrity while enabling autonomous evolution and testing methodologies specifically designed for non-deterministic and self-modifying systems. \r\n",

Those processes describe the delivery flow, the ability to go from requirements to working software and all of the SDLC steps in between. However, with the advent of LLMs now auto generating code, we have a maintenance issue wherein the knowledge of that code, the true usage of it and the optional semantic sugar sprinkled in becomes difficult to identify as time goes on. This gets greatly accelerated when the experience of the developer is simply not there. We always knew about Technical Debt, but are we prepared for the exponential rise in it as we embrace AI? Lean advocates for waste reduction, for a focus on standards, simplicity and the concept of value being added. This is a practice that software engineers simply have not been exposed to both in terms of how we write our code and how we protect our code equally.",

This session will showcase practical use cases, including automated testing, effortless JDK upgrades, and terminal integration, emphasizing how these capabilities are natively supported within the development environment rather than relying on external tools.\r\nWe will delve into the lifecycle of a workflow, beginning with the expert who initiates the process. You'll learn how experts iterate to refine these workflows and determine whether they evolve into fully autonomous systems or remain human-driven. Additionally, we will discuss how sharing common workflows within teams and across organizations facilitates knowledge transfer, allowing domain experts to share their insights and scale themselves. This collaborative approach enables non-experts to perform expert-level tasks, fostering a culture of shared learning and innovation.\r\nDiscover how IDE-based automation helps maintain zero technical debt, streamlines repetitive tasks, and places powerful innovation directly in the hands of developers. Step into the future of enterprise Java productivity, where agentic workflows become an integral part of your daily coding experience.",

The stuff that doesn't make it into the case studies. We'll talk about the most common grievances that disrupt a developer’s flow, from dealing with overly confident wrong answers to figuring out how to prompt for a useful solution.\r\n\r\nYou know that study showing developers take 19% longer to complete tasks with AI? Yeah, we'll talk about that too. Along with the productivity theater, the metrics that make no sense, and why \"seamless integration\" is apparently developer speak for \"good luck with that.\"\r\n\r\nWhether you're a developer drowning in AI mandates, a team lead trying to make sense of it all, or an engineering manager caught between executive enthusiasm and developer eye-rolls, come ready for validation, practical strategies, and maybe a few laughs about our collective journey into the AI-powered future.",

We'll check out the full landscape of tools at your disposal, from the newest JEPs in OpenJDK to GraalVM and Azul Platform Prime, and develop strategies to optimize whatever matters most to your team.",

This means we don't know what changed, and consequently fail to see how we can incorporate those in our usage of Git.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will look at some features you are probably aware of, but haven't used, alongside new features that Git has brought to the table. Examples include:\r\n\r\n- Rebase and interactive rebase\r\n- `restore`/`switch` and when to use them\r\n- worktrees\r\n- shallow-clones\r\n-  Git's filesystem monitor\r\n\r\nBy the end of this session, you will walk away with a slew of new tools in your arsenal, and a new perspective on how this can help you and your colleagues get the most out of Git.",

              "description": "We are entering the next wave of LLM understanding, so we want to make Natural Language Processing applications more reliable, robust, and trustworthy. This talk introduces the best practices and techniques for securing LLMs through guardrails that monitor and filter inputs and outputs. \r\n\r\nWe’ll examine how to effectively prevent malicious intent in inputs and protect against the exposure of sensitive data in outputs, using practical examples with Hugging Face and OpenAI models.\r\n\r\nThrough live demonstrations, attendees will learn how tools like LangChain4J can work together to detect and mitigate risks such as prompt injection attacks, unauthorized data access, poisoning RAG, and sanitization. \r\n\r\nThe session will conclude with a discussion on the evolving landscape of LLM security, the importance of vigilant permissions, and continuous monitoring to safeguard user and organizational data. This talk is ideal for developers, security practitioners, and anyone responsible for deploying LLMs into real-world applications.\r\n",

In fast-paced, collaborative environments, developers are expected to write excellent code and navigate communication, feedback, conflict, and change. But we rarely get formal training on how to do that well.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll explore the most underrated branches of the developer skill tree, empathy, communication, and adaptability, and how strengthening them can level up your impact, your team dynamics, and your career. You’ll walk away with practical strategies for having better 1:1s, asking smarter questions, staying flexible when requirements shift, and building a reputation as someone who makes teams better, not just codebases.\r\n\r\nWhether you're mentoring, contributing to open source, or navigating your next role, this talk will give you the tools to grow in the places your IDE can’t see.",

Experienced software developers have seen one too many monoliths devolve into a big ball of mud, leaving everyone frustrated, with an itch to do a \"rewrite\". But monoliths have their pros! They are usually simpler, easier to understand, and faster to build and debug. \r\n\r\nOn the other side of the spectrum you have microservices—that offer scale, both technically and organizationally, as well as having the badge of honor of being \"the new cool kid on the block\". But productionizing microservies is HARD. \r\n\r\nWhy can't we have our cake and eat it too? Turns out, we can. In this session we will explore the modular monolith—all the upsides of a monolith with none of the downsides of distributed architectures. We'll see what it means to build a modular monolith, and how that differs from a traditional layered architecture. We will discuss how we can build architectural governance to ensure our modules remain decoupled. Finally we'll see how our modules can communicate with one another without violating modularity. \r\n\r\nBy the end of this session you'll walk away with a greater appreciation for the monolith, and see how you can leverage this within your system architecture.

The Model Context Protocol offers a new integration path by letting your existing Java services talk to LLMs as first-class citizens.\r\n\r\nThis talk walks you through refactoring a legacy Java application into an AI-enabled agent using MCP. We’ll cover practical patterns for exposing services, handling tool calls, and streaming results plus strategies for controlling and auditing AI actions in production. You’ll see how MCP lets Java stay relevant in the fast-moving AI ecosystem without sacrificing stability.",

              "description": "AI coding agents have matured to the point that they need to be seriously considered for enterprise Java development and general SDLC tasks. CLI Tools like Claude Code, Google’s Gemini CLI, Amazon Q Developer, and OpenAI’s assistants are examples from leading large AI labs, but there are also smaller startups and open-source options. These agentic coding tools can reason about architecture, grok large code bases, and hold great promise to help developers ship software faster. They are often used in a “human in the loop” style, but they can also be instructed to execute autonomously until they determine the goal has been completed.\r\n\r\nThis talk introduces Spring AI Agents.  It provides a lightweight but powerful portable abstraction: the AgentClient. It acts as a consistent interface for invoking autonomous CLI-based agents. This allows developers to use the agentic tools they already have while providing flexibility to avoid locking into one single provider.   It also introduces Spring AI Bench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents on goal-directed enterprise-workflows.  It evaluates how effectively different agents have completed their goals and can be considered the test harness that runs any agent via Spring AI Agents.\r\n\r\nThese autonomous tools represent a significant opportunity to offload routine, but complex, development tasks, allowing developers to focus on higher-level architecture decisions, creative problem-solving, and strategic technical leadership. May the best agent win!",

As workloads expanded to include user-facing analytics, observability, and machine learning, the limitations of traditional monolithic architectures became apparent.\r\nThis talk examines the unbundling of the cloud data warehouse and the emergence of a modern data stack driven by open source technologies. We will discuss how databases like Postgres and ClickHouse, combined with open data lake standards such as Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Hudi, enable flexible, cost-effective, and high-performance solutions. By replacing traditional warehouses with composable and open architectures, organizations can build systems optimized for their specific real-time analytics and data processing needs.",

You’ll see where orchestration pays off, where it gets messy, and what it suggests about the future of applied multi-agent AI.",

This talk lays out a practical architecture playbook: move from request/response thinking to event-driven flows; use sagas/outbox for correctness; enforce circuit breakers/bulkheads for blast-radius control; shape service boundaries around domains and agent tasks; and wire in tracing, versioning, and deprecation for long-lived agents. You’ll leave with patterns, guardrails, and KPIs to integrate agents without breaking prod.\r\n\r\nWhat is Agentic AI in Microservices\r\n\r\nAgents plan, retry, chain services → need deterministic, idempotent APIs.\r\nServices must be tool-callable (stable operationId, strict schemas).\r\nSystems must survive retry storms + fan-out.\r\nWhy Monoliths & Non-Event Systems Fail\r\n\r\nLatency and tight coupling collapse under agent retries.\r\nNo event history → agents can’t re-plan.\r\nFailures amplify without bulkheads/circuit breakers.\r\nOps teams can’t see human vs agent traffic.\r\nCore Patterns for Agent-Friendly Systems\r\n\r\nEvent-driven flows: decouple, replay-safe.\r\nSaga/outbox: long workflows with compensations, reliable events.\r\nCircuit breakers/bulkheads: contain failure, reduce blast radius.\r\nService mesh/sidecars: centralize retries, telemetry, policies.\r\nDesigning Service Boundaries\r\n\r\nBoundaries around tasks/domains (Orders, Claims, Appointments).\r\nExpose task APIs (ReserveInventory, ScheduleAppointment).\r\nResponses = reason codes + next actions, not just raw data.\r\nAvoid polymorphism; keep contracts predictable.\r\nIntegrating Agent Frameworks\r\n\r\nTool calling: operationId as tool name; strict inputs/outputs.\r\nSupervisor/planner patterns: policy checks between steps.\r\nAsync jobs: job IDs, progress endpoints, webhooks.\r\nSafety: least privilege, quotas, payload validation.\r\nInfrastructure & Operations\r\n\r\nObservability: OpenTelemetry, x-agent-run-id, dashboards for retries & success rates.\r\nVersioning: SemVer, multi-version routing, Deprecation/Sunset headers.\r\nResilience: autoscale on retry rate; degrade to read-only mode; run failover drills.\r\nTakeaways\r\n\r\nDesign APIs for determinism, idempotency, and tool-callability.\r\nUse event-driven + saga/outbox for consistency.\r\nContain failures with circuit breakers, bulkheads, and meshes.\r\nMake service boundaries task-focused for agent workflows.\r\nSeparate and monitor agent vs human traffic.\r\nBuild lifecycle discipline: versioning, deprecation, multi-version gateways.",

We will explore different types of memory:\r\n\r\n- Episodic memory for storing events and experiences\r\n- Semantic memory for facts and knowledge\r\n- Working memory for short-term reasoning\r\n- Vector or embedding memory for fast retrieval across large contexts\r\n\r\nWe will then see how each of these can be implemented in AI agents, what challenges arise, and what trade-offs we need to consider. The goal is to give you both inspiration from human history and concrete tools for building better agents with memory.",

Which JARs are present? Which versions are actually on the classpath? Which Garbage Collector is being used? What JVM flags were set by default ergonomics and what is being customized?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll explore an AI-written tool for introspecting JVM during execution. \r\n\r\nI'll demonstrate how I wrote JLib Inspector to scan and analyze loaded JARs at runtime, as well as how to use similar feature in OpenTelemetry. And what else we can get from the JVM in production.",

Enterprise Java still powers the world with Spring as the dominant player.\r\n\r\nSo, what about Jakarta EE then? Most of the industry were affected in some way or the other by the namespace change from `javax.*` to `jakarta.*` in Jakarta EE 9, so there clearly are a lot of dependencies on the various Jakarta EE specifications.\r\n\r\nSpring is no exception. The framework builds on a surprisingly large set of Jakarta EE APIs and implementations. This means that it is a great advantage for a Spring developer to be aware of what is going on with the development of Jakarta EE.\r\n\r\nCome to this session to learn about the planned changes to the technologies that Spring depends on. There will be demos, and even some AI involved.",

            "description": "Engineering teams invest heavily in technical architecture while neglecting the behavioral architecture that determines their success. Just as we design systems for scalability, reliability, and performance, high-performing engineering teams require intentional design of behavioral patterns, feedback loops, and cultural practices that compound into extraordinary results. This session introduces a systematic framework for building behavioral architecture, the foundational habits, processes, and cultural patterns that transform good engineering teams into exceptional ones through small, deliberate changes. Unlike traditional team-building approaches that rely on sweeping organizational initiatives, this framework focuses on micro-behaviors that engineering leaders can implement immediately, regardless of formal systems or organizational constraints.\r\n\r\nDrawing inspiration from proven methodologies in sports psychology, organizational behavior, and atomic habits principles, attendees will discover how tiny behavioral changes in meetings, retrospectives, feedback delivery, and learning practices create compounding improvements in team performance, psychological safety, and innovation capability. The framework addresses the critical challenge facing modern engineering teams, building sustainable high performance through behavioral systems rather than relying solely on individual heroics or technical solutions.\r\n\r\nWe will review practical implementation guide covering behavioral expectations definition, trust-building systems, feedback architecture, and learning culture development through systematic habit formation rather than cultural mandates.",

In this 55-minute session, I’ll draw on two decades of experience leading zero-to-one initiatives at Coinbase, Ripple, and Yahoo to share the leadership styles, influence strategies, and measurement frameworks that turn forced adoption into sustained adoption. We’ll explore: the problem space and resistance patterns you’ll face, the techniques for aligning stakeholders without slowing execution, and the metrics that prove not just uptake, but enduring efficacy. Attendees will leave with a blueprint for leading change at scale, balancing persuasion with accountability, and ensuring that adoption sticks well beyond the launch announcement.",

While technically a well architected solution can horizontally scale, sometimes you need to ask if you should. \r\nCell architectures provide a pattern for deliberately deploying multiple instances of your application, each only providing services to a subset of your clients, allowing you to meet non-functional requirements such as resiliency, availability, scalability, isolation and cost management. \r\nIn this presentation we will talk about the Cell architecture pattern, the benefits, downsides and ways to change your thinking about your application architecture as it grows.",

While simple to start with, they often lead to tightly coupled code, difficult testing, and limited flexibility as systems grow. Hexagonal Architecture (a.k.a. Ports and Adapters) offers an alternative—one that places business logic at the center and decouples it from external concerns.\r\n\r\nWhat you’ll learn:\r\n\r\n🔹Key differences between traditional layered architecture and hexagonal architecture\r\n🔹Why hexagonal promotes cleaner boundaries and domain-driven design\r\n🔹Practical benefits: easier testing, maintainability, and adaptability to change\r\n🔹Common pitfalls when migrating from layered to hexagonal\r\n🔹Real-world scenarios where hexagonal shines (and when traditional still works)\r\n🔹Hands-on Java examples to illustrate both approaches\r\n\r\nBy the end, you’ll understand how to evaluate when to stick with a layered approach and when adopting hexagonal can future-proof your Java applications.",

Sometimes it’s just overhead, slowing you down when a plain SDK or direct API call would have worked better.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll share lessons learned from real MCP builds: the wins, the painful over-engineering, and the “wish we hadn’t done that” moments. Most importantly, we’ll give you a practical checklist to decide when MCP is worth it—and when it’s simply the wrong tool. You’ll walk away with clear guidance, battle-tested stories, and the confidence to avoid the mistakes we made.",

It uses transformer-based query reformulation, BM25 plus k-NN for dual retrieval, generative models for synthesis, and a ranking-feedback loop for continuous optimization. In tests, it beat standalone Elasticsearch and RAG on precision, recall, and ranking, all while keeping latency around 310 ms. This shows that blending lexical accuracy with semantic richness is the key to next-generation, real-time search—and we’re already looking at scaling it for multimodal queries and personalized results",

I also built feedback loops and compliance review integrations to ensure high accuracy and learning over time.\r\n\r\nThis solution represents one of the first enterprise-scale applications of Generative AI specifically tailored for supply chain compliance workflows. Prior systems required heavy human intervention and manual documentation. By embedding a RAG-powered architecture that combines audit-specific retrieval with large language model reasoning, this project introduces a novel way to automate judgment-based compliance tasks — a space typically untouched by AI at scale. It is also designed to evolve into an intelligent audit expert, a rare implementation of self-improving GenAI in regulatory environments.",

That’s why they sometimes forget, contradict themselves, or fail to connect the dots across conversations. In enterprise settings, these failures aren’t just quirks—they’re risks to adoption, reliability, and ROI.\r\nThis talk explores the evolution of AI memory and reasoning:\r\n• RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): fetching external knowledge when the model doesn’t know enough.\r\n• CAG (Context-Augmented Generation): enriching answers with curated, structured context for higher accuracy.\r\n• Context Graphs: a breakthrough that gives AI something closer to long-term memory, explainability, and reasoning.\r\nWe’ll also show how agentic AI design patterns—like Planner-Executor, Critic-Actor, and Memory-Augmented Agents—become powerful when combined with these advances.\r\n\r\nWhy this talk matters (Strategic ROI)\r\n• Reduce wasted cycles: Minimize hallucinations and rework, lowering the cost of errors.\r\n• Increase productivity: Agents with reliable memory scale beyond demos to handle real workflows.\r\n• Build trust & adoption: Explainable AI reduces resistance from compliance, risk, and business stakeholders.\r\n• Future-proof investment: Context graphs evolve with data, ensuring long-term adaptability.\r\n\r\nWho should attend\r\n• AI newcomers curious why models forget and how memory can be extended.\r\n• Engineers seeking practical design patterns to build production-ready AI.\r\n• Leaders looking to understand how better AI memory drives ROI and enterprise readiness.\r\n\r\nKey takeaway\r\nAI is moving beyond prompts and short-term context. By the end of this session, you’ll see how the field is evolving—from context windows → RAG → CAG → context graphs—and why this evolution is not just a technical leap, but a strategic one, enabling reliable, scalable, and ROI-driven Generative + Agentic AI systems.",

Without it, even the most advanced models can misinterpret information, lose track of details, or arrive at conclusions that don’t hold up. Context engineering is emerging as a discipline that shapes how AI perceives, recalls, and reasons about information.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore how context provides the foundation for reasoning, problem solving, and explainability in AI. We will look at techniques such as connected memory, contextual retrieval, and graph-based knowledge representation that give large language models a more reliable way to connect information and draw logical conclusions.\r\n\r\nAttendees will come away with a practical understanding of how to design effective context pipelines that align AI with real-world knowledge and user intent, and why context engineering is becoming a central part of building trustworthy and impactful AI systems.",

It's the bridge we've been missing between AI reasoning and real-time data systems.\r\nTeams build AI applications that work great in demos but fall apart with production data. Your agents analyze historical reports but can't tell what's happening in your Kafka streams. They're blind to schema changes and disconnected from events that matter to your business.\r\nInstead of treating streaming platforms like black boxes, you expose them directly to your agents via MCP protocol. Suddenly, your AI doesn't just read about data—it lives inside your data flows.\r\nLearn what becomes possible when you stop thinking about AI as an external service and start treating it as part of your streaming architecture. We'll build systems where agents subscribe to real-time events, reason about evolving schemas, and make decisions that ripple through your data platform.",

            "description": "When running Java in the cloud, the JVM startup time can become a limitation. Especially when you look at spinning up new instances of an app as response to changes in load, the warmup time can be a problem. A couple of years ago you only had CDS that could help you with the startup but meanwhile there are a couple of solutions that can help you to let you JVM start super fast. These days we have CRaC, Native Image, Leyden, InstantOn, Ready Now, JITServer and Cloud Native Compiler, which are all solutions that help to reduce the startup time of a JVM. Each of those is not a Silver Bullet, so you have to choose the right solution for your problem.\r\nThis session will give you a short overview of the different solutions to increase your JVM startup performance and will try to give you some hints on how to choose the right solution for your application.",

Like living in a self-cleaning castle, it takes care of the mess so we can focus on other things. But while it feels automatic, there’s a lot happening behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll explore the fundamentals of garbage collection through the lens of life in a castle with my cat: what it cleans up, how it works, and why it sometimes causes trouble. We’ll walk through some core techniques, their trade-offs, and the optimizations that make them more efficient. From there, we’ll dive into modern Java garbage collectors looking at how they build on these principles to meet today’s performance demands.\r\n\r\nBy the end, you’ll have a clear understanding of how garbage collection works, why it matters, and how overlooking it can cause problems when we least expect it",

By learning these key concepts, you’ll learn to save time not trying to optimize the things that the compiler can already do for you and to focus on the things that matter most.",

But with so many options, the question is: which ones should we use today, which still matter, and which belong in the history books?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll explore the entire spectrum:\r\n* Classic Threads – the original concurrency primitive.\r\n* Parallel Streams – data parallelism for the collections era.\r\n* Futures & CompletableFuture – async results with callbacks and chaining.\r\n* Reactive Programming – backpressure, publishers, and the rise of frameworks like Reactor and RxJava.\r\n* Virtual Threads – Lightweight Concurrency Made Mainstream.\r\n* Structured Concurrency – Taming async chaos with lifetimes and scopes.\r\n* Vector API – data-level parallelism on modern CPUs.\r\n\r\nWe’ll also tackle the hard questions:\r\n* Do virtual threads really kill the need for reactive programming?\r\n* What do developers mean by “hidden stack traces,” and how do they impact debugging and profiling?\r\n* Where should you invest today, and what patterns should you abandon permanently?",

This talk will dive into the new Spring tools and annotations, such as the @ApiVersion annotation and enhanced RequestMapping capabilities. We will discuss multiple different versioning implementations, including: URI parameters, headers, and query parameters. Attendees will discover how to implement API versioning in Spring Boot applications. We will also see how the API versioning feature is used in Interface Clients, Spring Cloud Gateway and Spring Cloud Load Balancer.",

However, the CNCF Graduated Project KEDA, short for Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling, offers a wide array of options. One of these includes using metrics exposed by Prometheus, another CNCF Graduated project.   Micrometer, an open-source metrics facade that integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot, can expose many different metrics from an application in a format that is understood by Prometheus. Come to this session to learn how you can put all of these together to use KEDA with out of the box Spring metrics or even with your own custom metrics to drive the autoscaling of your application in Kubernetes.

Copying code from the internet or trusting your AI assistant too much can introduce unsafe logic. Adding libraries without checking them and running container images you did not build can silently expose your application to attacks.\r\n\r\nIn this session, you will see how modern Java stacks become vulnerable through real-world examples and live hacking. From untrusted dependencies to misconfigured containers, we will explore the common traps developers fall into. You will walk away with practical techniques to spot these risks early and keep your code secure in the cloud-native world.",

But as the role of streaming grows, so does the risk - because many streaming platforms, like Apache Kafka, aren't secure by default.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll take a practical look at data streaming security through the lens of Kafka, one of the most widely adopted streaming platforms in the world. We'll walk through what can go wrong - like Gamooga's public Kafka broker leaking 17GB of customer data in two hours, or GonnaOrder exposing years of real-time delivery info to the internet - and what it takes to do it right.\r\n\r\nWe'll cover the key pillars of securing a streaming system: encryption in transit and at rest, access control, monitoring, and key management. Along the way, we’ll look at the trade-offs like disk encryption vs. end-to-end encryption, what is behind field-level and envelope encryption, and the realities of using customer-managed keys in regulated industries.\r\n\r\nWe'll also explore how streaming security has evolved, how real vulnerabilities (like CVE-2019-12399) highlight the need for patching and monitoring, and what successful multi-layered security looks like in production - from financial institutions to healthcare platforms.\r\n\r\nIf you're building, running, or scaling streaming systems, this talk will help you see the security blind spots and give you concrete steps to protect the data flowing through your pipelines.",

It ensures that privacy is not an afterthought, but a fundamental aspect of how systems and processes are built.\r\nBy systematically embedding privacy by design principles into DevSecOps, organizations can build more secure, compliant, and trustworthy applications and systems, ultimately benefiting both the business and its users.\r\nPrivacy by Design (PbD) is a fundamental approach to application security that ensures privacy is embedded into the design and architecture of IT systems, business practices, and networked infrastructure from the very beginning, rather than being an afterthought. It shifts the responsibility for data protection away from users and onto the organizations collecting, storing, and sharing the data.\r\n",

And we did it by embracing the era we live in: the age of AI. From design to implementation, we leveraged AI tooling and techniques to move faster, think broader, and deliver sooner.\r\n\r\nCode changes. So should your language skills. One day, you’re building for the web. The next, for APIs, tablets, or serverless. The future is multi‑runtime. BoxLang is ready.\r\n\r\nDynamic. Modular. Productive. It’s expressive and functional, yet 100% Java‑compatible. It integrates anywhere, from legacy stacks to modern frameworks, with an instant Java ecosystem at your fingertips. Even a multi‑parser design lets you bring legacy code into a modern runtime without compromise.\r\n\r\nFrom a 6 MB OS binary to running on CommandBox, Jakarta EE, AWS Lambda, Microsoft Functions, IoT, and more — BoxLang adapts to every runtime you throw at it.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of how we built a language from scratch with strict goals: speed, flexibility, and developer‑first design — proving that in the age of AI, a small, passionate team can deliver significant innovations.",

The good news is that a growing set of developer-friendly tools—both open-source and commercial—can help. From static code analyzers to automated testing, framework migration, and vulnerability detection tools, developers now have powerful allies to handle routine, compliance-heavy tasks efficiently.\r\n\r\nThis talk explores a set of practical tools that integrate well into Java development workflows, helping teams ship better code faster while meeting organizational requirements.

              "description": "Great Scott! The robots are coming for your job—and this time, they brought unit tests. Join Doc and Marty from the Software Future (Baruch and Leonid) as they race back in time to help you fight the machines using only your domain expertise, a well-structured prompt, and a pinch of Gherkin. This keynote is your survival guide for the AI age: how to close the intent-to-prompt chasm before it swallows your roadmap, how to weaponize the Intent Integrity Chain to steer AI output safely, and why the Art of the Possible is your most powerful resistance tool. Expect:\r\n- Bad puns\r\n- Good tests\r\n- Wild demos\r\n\r\nThe machines may be fast. But with structure, constraint, and a little time travel, you’ll still be the one writing the future.",

While technically a well architected solution can horizontally scale, sometimes you need to ask if you should. \r\nCell architectures provide a pattern for deliberately deploying multiple instances of your application, each only providing services to a subset of your clients, allowing you to meet non-functional requirements such as resiliency, availability, scalability, isolation and cost management. \r\nIn this presentation we will talk about the Cell architecture pattern, the benefits, downsides and ways to change your thinking about your application architecture as it grows.",

You’ll see how moving beyond freestyle prompting enables better reuse, stronger tests-as-guardrails, and smoother transitions when frameworks or requirements change.\r\n\r\nWe’ll walk through real-world examples showing how specs can help keep code and AI aligned, even during ongoing iteration and team collaboration. \r\n\r\nIf you’ve ever felt like Copilot was helping you fly in circles, this talk offers a way to move forward, with direction.\r\n",

This system ingests supplier audit findings and intelligently generates tailored Corrective Action Plans (CAPs). My role included designing the technical architecture, training and fine-tuning LLMs, integrating Apple’s audit standards into the system, and deploying the solution within Apple’s SupplierCare portal. I also built feedback loops and compliance review integrations to ensure high accuracy and learning over time.\r\n\r\nThis solution represents one of the first enterprise-scale applications of Generative AI specifically tailored for supply chain compliance workflows. Prior systems required heavy human intervention and manual documentation. By embedding a RAG-powered architecture that combines audit-specific retrieval with large language model reasoning, this project introduces a novel way to automate judgment-based compliance tasks — a space typically untouched by AI at scale. It is also designed to evolve into an intelligent audit expert, a rare implementation of self-improving GenAI in regulatory environments.",

Especially when you look at spinning up new instances of an app as response to changes in load, the warmup time can be a problem. A couple of years ago you only had CDS that could help you with the startup but meanwhile there are a couple of solutions that can help you to let you JVM start super fast. These days we have CRaC, Native Image, Leyden, InstantOn, Ready Now, JITServer and Cloud Native Compiler, which are all solutions that help to reduce the startup time of a JVM. Each of those is not a Silver Bullet, so you have to choose the right solution for your problem.\r\nThis session will give you a short overview of the different solutions to increase your JVM startup performance and will try to give you some hints on how to choose the right solution for your application.",

Copying code from the internet or trusting your AI assistant too much can introduce unsafe logic. Adding libraries without checking them and running container images you did not build can silently expose your application to attacks.\r\n\r\nIn this session, you will see how modern Java stacks become vulnerable through real-world examples and live hacking. From untrusted dependencies to misconfigured containers, we will explore the common traps developers fall into.

From design to implementation, we leveraged AI tooling and techniques to move faster, think broader, and deliver sooner.\r\n\r\nCode changes. So should your language skills. One day, you’re building for the web. The next, for APIs, tablets, or serverless. The future is multi‑runtime. BoxLang is ready.\r\n\r\nDynamic. Modular. Productive. It’s expressive and functional, yet 100% Java‑compatible. It integrates anywhere, from legacy stacks to modern frameworks, with an instant Java ecosystem at your fingertips. Even a multi‑parser design lets you bring legacy code into a modern runtime without compromise.\r\n\r\nFrom a 6 MB OS binary to running on CommandBox, Jakarta EE, AWS Lambda, Microsoft Functions, IoT, and more — BoxLang adapts to every runtime you throw at it.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of how we built a language from scratch with strict goals: speed, flexibility, and developer‑first design — proving that in the age of AI, a small, passionate team can deliver significant innovations.",

              "description": "Traditional layered architectures (controllers, services, repositories) have been the default choice for many Java applications. While simple to start with, they often lead to tightly coupled code, difficult testing, and limited flexibility as systems grow. Hexagonal Architecture (a.k.a. Ports and Adapters) offers an alternative—one that places business logic at the center and decouples it from external concerns.\r\n\r\nWhat you’ll learn:\r\n\r\n🔹Key differences between traditional layered architecture and hexagonal architecture\r\n🔹Why hexagonal promotes cleaner boundaries and domain-driven design\r\n🔹Practical benefits: easier testing, maintainability, and adaptability to change\r\n🔹Common pitfalls when migrating from layered to hexagonal\r\n🔹Real-world scenarios where hexagonal shines (and when traditional still works)\r\n🔹Hands-on Java examples to illustrate both approaches\r\n\r\nBy the end, you’ll understand how to evaluate when to stick with a layered approach and when adopting hexagonal can future-proof your Java applications.",

MCP is powerful: it standardizes how LLMs connect with tools, prompts, and resources. But here’s the hard truth: not every use case deserves an MCP server. Sometimes it’s just overhead, slowing you down when a plain SDK or direct API call would have worked better.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll share lessons learned from real MCP builds: the wins, the painful over-engineering, and the “wish we hadn’t done that” moments. Most importantly, we’ll give you a practical checklist to decide when MCP is worth it—and when it’s simply the wrong tool. You’ll walk away with clear guidance, battle-tested stories, and the confidence to avoid the mistakes we made.",

It's the bridge we've been missing between AI reasoning and real-time data systems.\r\nTeams build AI applications that work great in demos but fall apart with production data. Your agents analyze historical reports but can't tell what's happening in your Kafka streams. They're blind to schema changes and disconnected from events that matter to your business.\r\nInstead of treating streaming platforms like black boxes, you expose them directly to your agents via MCP protocol. Suddenly, your AI doesn't just read about data—it lives inside your data flows.\r\nLearn what becomes possible when you stop thinking about AI as an external service and start treating it as part of your streaming architecture. We'll build systems where agents subscribe to real-time events, reason about evolving schemas, and make decisions that ripple through your data platform.",

We’ll walk through some core techniques, their trade-offs, and the optimizations that make them more efficient. From there, we’ll dive into modern Java garbage collectors looking at how they build on these principles to meet today’s performance demands.\r\n\r\nBy the end, you’ll have a clear understanding of how garbage collection works, why it matters, and how overlooking it can cause problems when we least expect it",

Micrometer, an open-source metrics facade that integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot, can expose many different metrics from an application in a format that is understood by Prometheus. Come to this session to learn how you can put all of these together to use KEDA with out of the box Spring metrics or even with your own custom metrics to drive the autoscaling of your application in Kubernetes.

Just as we design systems for scalability, reliability, and performance, high-performing engineering teams require intentional design of behavioral patterns, feedback loops, and cultural practices that compound into extraordinary results. This session introduces a systematic framework for building behavioral architecture, the foundational habits, processes, and cultural patterns that transform good engineering teams into exceptional ones through small, deliberate changes. Unlike traditional team-building approaches that rely on sweeping organizational initiatives, this framework focuses on micro-behaviors that engineering leaders can implement immediately, regardless of formal systems or organizational constraints.\r\n\r\nDrawing inspiration from proven methodologies in sports psychology, organizational behavior, and atomic habits principles, attendees will discover how tiny behavioral changes in meetings, retrospectives, feedback delivery, and learning practices create compounding improvements in team performance, psychological safety, and innovation capability. The framework addresses the critical challenge facing modern engineering teams, building sustainable high performance through behavioral systems rather than relying solely on individual heroics or technical solutions.\r\n\r\nWe will review practical implementation guide covering behavioral expectations definition, trust-building systems, feedback architecture, and learning culture development through systematic habit formation rather than cultural mandates.",

              "description": "We’ve built a modular, hybrid search architecture that combines Elasticsearch’s speed with Retrieval-Augmented Generation’s semantic depth, delivering context-aware, accurate answers in real time. It uses transformer-based query reformulation, BM25 plus k-NN for dual retrieval, generative models for synthesis, and a ranking-feedback loop for continuous optimization. In tests, it beat standalone Elasticsearch and RAG on precision, recall, and ranking, all while keeping latency around 310 ms. This shows that blending lexical accuracy with semantic richness is the key to next-generation, real-time search—and we’re already looking at scaling it for multimodal queries and personalized results",

              "description": "Abstract\r\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have captured everyone’s imagination—but under the hood, they’re limited by a simple fact: they can only “remember” what fits into a context window. That’s why they sometimes forget, contradict themselves, or fail to connect the dots across conversations. In enterprise settings, these failures aren’t just quirks—they’re risks to adoption, reliability, and ROI.\r\nThis talk explores the evolution of AI memory and reasoning:\r\n• RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): fetching external knowledge when the model doesn’t know enough.\r\n• CAG (Context-Augmented Generation): enriching answers with curated, structured context for higher accuracy.\r\n• Context Graphs: a breakthrough that gives AI something closer to long-term memory, explainability, and reasoning.\r\nWe’ll also show how agentic AI design patterns—like Planner-Executor, Critic-Actor, and Memory-Augmented Agents—become powerful when combined with these advances.\r\n\r\nWhy this talk matters (Strategic ROI)\r\n• Reduce wasted cycles: Minimize hallucinations and rework, lowering the cost of errors.\r\n• Increase productivity: Agents with reliable memory scale beyond demos to handle real workflows.\r\n• Build trust & adoption: Explainable AI reduces resistance from compliance, risk, and business stakeholders.\r\n• Future-proof investment: Context graphs evolve with data, ensuring long-term adaptability.\r\n\r\nWho should attend\r\n• AI newcomers curious why models forget and how memory can be extended.\r\n• Engineers seeking practical design patterns to build production-ready AI.\r\n• Leaders looking to understand how better AI memory drives ROI and enterprise readiness.\r\n\r\nKey takeaway\r\nAI is moving beyond prompts and short-term context. By the end of this session, you’ll see how the field is evolving—from context windows → RAG → CAG → context graphs—and why this evolution is not just a technical leap, but a strategic one, enabling reliable, scalable, and ROI-driven Generative + Agentic AI systems.",

They’re also responsible for meeting company-wide standards—fixing vulnerabilities, upgrading frameworks and Java versions, and ensuring quality metrics like code coverage, technical debt, and security are in check.\r\n\r\nThese tasks, while critical, often compete with feature development and can slow teams down. The good news is that a growing set of developer-friendly tools—both open-source and commercial—can help. From static code analyzers to automated testing, framework migration, and vulnerability detection tools, developers now have powerful allies to handle routine, compliance-heavy tasks efficiently.\r\n\r\nThis talk explores a set of practical tools that integrate well into Java development workflows, helping teams ship better code faster while meeting organizational requirements. You’ll leave with actionable insights on boosting productivity, improving software quality, and making compliance a seamless part of the development process.",

This session introduces Agentic AI for Java microservices, an approach that integrates autonomous agents directly into your architecture to achieve self-optimization, predictive scaling, and real-time performance tuning. Drawing on my experience in FinTech and cloud-native systems, I will share architecture patterns, code examples, and lessons learned from building high-volume transaction platforms. Attendees will learn how to evolve from traditional auto-scaling to AI-driven self-optimization and leave with a practical roadmap for implementing these techniques in their own Java applications.",

But with so many options, the question is: which ones should we use today, which still matter, and which belong in the history books?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll explore the entire spectrum:\r\n* Classic Threads – the original concurrency primitive.\r\n* Parallel Streams – data parallelism for the collections era.\r\n* Futures & CompletableFuture – async results with callbacks and chaining.\r\n* Reactive Programming – backpressure, publishers, and the rise of frameworks like Reactor and RxJava.\r\n* Virtual Threads – Lightweight Concurrency Made Mainstream.\r\n* Structured Concurrency – Taming async chaos with lifetimes and scopes.\r\n* Vector API – data-level parallelism on modern CPUs.\r\n\r\nWe’ll also tackle the hard questions:\r\n* Do virtual threads really kill the need for reactive programming?\r\n* What do developers mean by “hidden stack traces,” and how do they impact debugging and profiling?\r\n* Where should you invest today, and what patterns should you abandon permanently?",

But as the role of streaming grows, so does the risk - because many streaming platforms, like Apache Kafka, aren't secure by default.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll take a practical look at data streaming security through the lens of Kafka, one of the most widely adopted streaming platforms in the world. We'll walk through what can go wrong - like Gamooga's public Kafka broker leaking 17GB of customer data in two hours, or GonnaOrder exposing years of real-time delivery info to the internet - and what it takes to do it right.\r\n\r\nWe'll cover the key pillars of securing a streaming system: encryption in transit and at rest, access control, monitoring, and key management. Along the way, we’ll look at the trade-offs like disk encryption vs. end-to-end encryption, what is behind field-level and envelope encryption, and the realities of using customer-managed keys in regulated industries.\r\n\r\nWe'll also explore how streaming security has evolved, how real vulnerabilities (like CVE-2019-12399) highlight the need for patching and monitoring, and what successful multi-layered security looks like in production - from financial institutions to healthcare platforms.\r\n\r\nIf you're building, running, or scaling streaming systems, this talk will help you see the security blind spots and give you concrete steps to protect the data flowing through your pipelines.",

While frameworks like SPACE, getDX, and DORA metrics provide valuable insights, they often miss the mark on capturing developers' real, day-to-day experiences using tools and services, instead focusing strictly on the bottom line for the company. \r\nThis talk will explore the origins and evolution of \"developer experience,\" dissect popular frameworks, and advocate for a more balanced approach that values the practitioner's perspective. At the end we will set a path towards integrating top-down metrics with bottom-up feedback, ensuring an approach to developer experience that fosters innovation and satisfaction.",
