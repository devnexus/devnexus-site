        "description": "Everyone's talking about AI creating 10x engineers. Meanwhile, you're over here debugging hallucinated code at 2 AM, wondering if the AI is gaslighting you or if you've finally lost it.\r\n\r\nIf you've ever found yourself arguing with a chatbot or watching your productivity mysteriously plummet while your manager celebrates the \"AI transformation,\" this talk is your therapy session.\r\n\r\nWe're diving into the messy reality of AI adoption in software development. The stuff that doesn't make it into the case studies. We'll talk about the most common grievances that disrupt a developer’s flow, from dealing with overly confident wrong answers to figuring out how to prompt for a useful solution.\r\n\r\nYou know that study showing developers take 19% longer to complete tasks with AI? Yeah, we'll talk about that too. Along with the productivity theater, the metrics that make no sense, and why \"seamless integration\" is apparently developer speak for \"good luck with that.\"\r\n\r\nWhether you're a developer drowning in AI mandates, a team lead trying to make sense of it all, or an engineering manager caught between executive enthusiasm and developer eye-rolls, come ready for validation, practical strategies, and maybe a few laughs about our collective journey into the AI-powered future.",

        "description": "Modern enterprise Java systems handle millions of financial transactions every day. Yet scaling them reliably and cost-effectively in the cloud is a constant challenge. This session introduces Agentic AI for Java microservices, an approach that integrates autonomous agents directly into your architecture to achieve self-optimization, predictive scaling, and real-time performance tuning. Drawing on my experience in FinTech and cloud-native systems, I will share architecture patterns, code examples, and lessons learned from building high-volume transaction platforms. Attendees will learn how to evolve from traditional auto-scaling to AI-driven self-optimization and leave with a practical roadmap for implementing these techniques in their own Java applications.",

And you’re watching unsettling YouTube posts about how GenAI will take your job or that 90% of all AI projects fail.  Pretty scary, right?\r\n\r\nIn this session, I will fast-track you through AI/ML focused on Java developers who need to get the job done without the need to drill down into data science and complicated math. \r\nThis presentation is designed for junior and intermediate Java developers who need to understand how non-deterministic tools can be effectively utilized throughout the software development process. You will gain a practical introduction to AI and Machine Learning with a focus on the Java ecosystem, featuring hands-on coding using LangChain4j, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other APIs. \r\n\r\nThis session will cover how neural networks and large language models (LLMs) process information, how to craft effective prompts and manage context, and how to use embeddings and vector databases to support Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for helpful responses. We will explore reusable prompt templates, the building blocks of chatbot architectures, and provide a brief introduction to agents, all while learning how to integrate GenAI in an ethical and responsible manner and manage potential risks. \r\n\r\nBy the end of this presentation, you should understand the very essence of AI/ML, so that you will understand what AI is and how to use it for successful deployments properly.  \r\n",

        "description": "Agents don’t just “call APIs”—they plan, retry, chain, and orchestrate across services. That changes how we design microservices, boundaries, workflows, and ops. This talk lays out a practical architecture playbook: move from request/response thinking to event-driven flows; use sagas/outbox for correctness; enforce circuit breakers/bulkheads for blast-radius control; shape service boundaries around domains and agent tasks; and wire in tracing, versioning, and deprecation for long-lived agents. You’ll leave with patterns, guardrails, and KPIs to integrate agents without breaking prod.\r\n\r\nWhat is Agentic AI in Microservices\r\n\r\nAgents plan, retry, chain services → need deterministic, idempotent APIs.\r\nServices must be tool-callable (stable operationId, strict schemas).\r\nSystems must survive retry storms + fan-out.\r\nWhy Monoliths & Non-Event Systems Fail\r\n\r\nLatency and tight coupling collapse under agent retries.\r\nNo event history → agents can’t re-plan.\r\nFailures amplify without bulkheads/circuit breakers.\r\nOps teams can’t see human vs agent traffic.\r\nCore Patterns for Agent-Friendly Systems\r\n\r\nEvent-driven flows: decouple, replay-safe.\r\nSaga/outbox: long workflows with compensations, reliable events.\r\nCircuit breakers/bulkheads: contain failure, reduce blast radius.\r\nService mesh/sidecars: centralize retries, telemetry, policies.\r\nDesigning Service Boundaries\r\n\r\nBoundaries around tasks/domains (Orders, Claims, Appointments).\r\nExpose task APIs (ReserveInventory, ScheduleAppointment).\r\nResponses = reason codes + next actions, not just raw data.\r\nAvoid polymorphism; keep contracts predictable.\r\nIntegrating Agent Frameworks\r\n\r\nTool calling: operationId as tool name; strict inputs/outputs.\r\nSupervisor/planner patterns: policy checks between steps.\r\nAsync jobs: job IDs, progress endpoints, webhooks.\r\nSafety: least privilege, quotas, payload validation.\r\nInfrastructure & Operations\r\n\r\nObservability: OpenTelemetry, x-agent-run-id, dashboards for retries & success rates.\r\nVersioning: SemVer, multi-version routing, Deprecation/Sunset headers.\r\nResilience: autoscale on retry rate; degrade to read-only mode; run failover drills.\r\nTakeaways\r\n\r\nDesign APIs for determinism, idempotency, and tool-callability.\r\nUse event-driven + saga/outbox for consistency.\r\nContain failures with circuit breakers, bulkheads, and meshes.\r\nMake service boundaries task-focused for agent workflows.\r\nSeparate and monitor agent vs human traffic.\r\nBuild lifecycle discipline: versioning, deprecation, multi-version gateways.",

Micrometer, an open-source metrics facade that integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot, can expose many different metrics from an application in a format that is understood by Prometheus. Come to this session to learn how you can put all of these together to use KEDA with out of the box Spring metrics or even with your own custom metrics to drive the autoscaling of your application in Kubernetes.

        "description": "Great Scott! The robots are coming for your job—and this time, they brought unit tests. Join Doc and Marty from the Software Future (Baruch and Leonid) as they race back in time to help you fight the machines using only your domain expertise, a well-structured prompt, and a pinch of Gherkin. This keynote is your survival guide for the AI age: how to close the intent-to-prompt chasm before it swallows your roadmap, how to weaponize the Intent Integrity Chain to steer AI output safely, and why the Art of the Possible is your most powerful resistance tool. Expect:\r\n- Bad puns\r\n- Good tests\r\n- Wild demos\r\n\r\nThe machines may be fast. But with structure, constraint, and a little time travel, you’ll still be the one writing the future.",

        "description": "Engineering teams invest heavily in technical architecture while neglecting the behavioral architecture that determines their success. Just as we design systems for scalability, reliability, and performance, high-performing engineering teams require intentional design of behavioral patterns, feedback loops, and cultural practices that compound into extraordinary results. This session introduces a systematic framework for building behavioral architecture, the foundational habits, processes, and cultural patterns that transform good engineering teams into exceptional ones through small, deliberate changes. Unlike traditional team-building approaches that rely on sweeping organizational initiatives, this framework focuses on micro-behaviors that engineering leaders can implement immediately, regardless of formal systems or organizational constraints.\r\n\r\nDrawing inspiration from proven methodologies in sports psychology, organizational behavior, and atomic habits principles, attendees will discover how tiny behavioral changes in meetings, retrospectives, feedback delivery, and learning practices create compounding improvements in team performance, psychological safety, and innovation capability. The framework addresses the critical challenge facing modern engineering teams, building sustainable high performance through behavioral systems rather than relying solely on individual heroics or technical solutions.\r\n\r\nWe will review practical implementation guide covering behavioral expectations definition, trust-building systems, feedback architecture, and learning culture development through systematic habit formation rather than cultural mandates.",

        "description": "AI systems need more than intelligence; they need context. Without it, even the most advanced models can misinterpret information, lose track of details, or arrive at conclusions that don’t hold up. Context engineering is emerging as a discipline that shapes how AI perceives, recalls, and reasons about information.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore how context provides the foundation for reasoning, problem solving, and explainability in AI. We will look at techniques such as connected memory, contextual retrieval, and graph-based knowledge representation that give large language models a more reliable way to connect information and draw logical conclusions.\r\n\r\nAttendees will come away with a practical understanding of how to design effective context pipelines that align AI with real-world knowledge and user intent, and why context engineering is becoming a central part of building trustworthy and impactful AI systems.",

        "description": "We’ve built a modular, hybrid search architecture that combines Elasticsearch’s speed with Retrieval-Augmented Generation’s semantic depth, delivering context-aware, accurate answers in real time. It uses transformer-based query reformulation, BM25 plus k-NN for dual retrieval, generative models for synthesis, and a ranking-feedback loop for continuous optimization. In tests, it beat standalone Elasticsearch and RAG on precision, recall, and ranking, all while keeping latency around 310 ms. This shows that blending lexical accuracy with semantic richness is the key to next-generation, real-time search—and we’re already looking at scaling it for multimodal queries and personalized results",

But as the role of streaming grows, so does the risk - because many streaming platforms, like Apache Kafka, aren't secure by default.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll take a practical look at data streaming security through the lens of Kafka, one of the most widely adopted streaming platforms in the world. We'll walk through what can go wrong - like Gamooga's public Kafka broker leaking 17GB of customer data in two hours, or GonnaOrder exposing years of real-time delivery info to the internet - and what it takes to do it right.\r\n\r\nWe'll cover the key pillars of securing a streaming system: encryption in transit and at rest, access control, monitoring, and key management. Along the way, we’ll look at the trade-offs like disk encryption vs. end-to-end encryption, what is behind field-level and envelope encryption, and the realities of using customer-managed keys in regulated industries.\r\n\r\nWe'll also explore how streaming security has evolved, how real vulnerabilities (like CVE-2019-12399) highlight the need for patching and monitoring, and what successful multi-layered security looks like in production - from financial institutions to healthcare platforms.\r\n\r\nIf you're building, running, or scaling streaming systems, this talk will help you see the security blind spots and give you concrete steps to protect the data flowing through your pipelines.",

        "description": "Abstract\r\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have captured everyone’s imagination—but under the hood, they’re limited by a simple fact: they can only “remember” what fits into a context window. That’s why they sometimes forget, contradict themselves, or fail to connect the dots across conversations. In enterprise settings, these failures aren’t just quirks—they’re risks to adoption, reliability, and ROI.\r\nThis talk explores the evolution of AI memory and reasoning:\r\n• RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): fetching external knowledge when the model doesn’t know enough.\r\n• CAG (Context-Augmented Generation): enriching answers with curated, structured context for higher accuracy.\r\n• Context Graphs: a breakthrough that gives AI something closer to long-term memory, explainability, and reasoning.\r\nWe’ll also show how agentic AI design patterns—like Planner-Executor, Critic-Actor, and Memory-Augmented Agents—become powerful when combined with these advances.\r\n\r\nWhy this talk matters (Strategic ROI)\r\n• Reduce wasted cycles: Minimize hallucinations and rework, lowering the cost of errors.\r\n• Increase productivity: Agents with reliable memory scale beyond demos to handle real workflows.\r\n• Build trust & adoption: Explainable AI reduces resistance from compliance, risk, and business stakeholders.\r\n• Future-proof investment: Context graphs evolve with data, ensuring long-term adaptability.\r\n\r\nWho should attend\r\n• AI newcomers curious why models forget and how memory can be extended.\r\n• Engineers seeking practical design patterns to build production-ready AI.\r\n• Leaders looking to understand how better AI memory drives ROI and enterprise readiness.\r\n\r\nKey takeaway\r\nAI is moving beyond prompts and short-term context. By the end of this session, you’ll see how the field is evolving—from context windows → RAG → CAG → context graphs—and why this evolution is not just a technical leap, but a strategic one, enabling reliable, scalable, and ROI-driven Generative + Agentic AI systems.",

        "description": "Agentic coding assistants and editor based AI chat interfaces are altering the development workflow leading some to proclaim the end of software engineering. Is it time to explore other careers? Not so fast, the rumors of our demise are greatly exaggerated! While these tools can boost productivity, to be used effectively, developers still need to master the fundamentals of the software craft. Modern software development demands more than just coding proficiency—it requires navigating an increasingly AI-augmented landscape. This intensive workshop bridges the critical gap between what early-career developers learn in formal education and what they need to thrive in professional environments where human expertise and artificial intelligence increasingly collaborate. Based on our book \"Fundamentals of Software Engineering,\" we guide participants through a comprehensive journey from programmer to well-rounded software engineer equipped to leverage AI tools effectively while maintaining engineering fundamentals.\r\n\r\nParticipants will develop both technical capabilities and professional skills that remain relevant regardless of changing languages, frameworks, and AI capabilities. Through a balanced mix of conceptual teaching, collaborative discussions, and hands-on exercises with both traditional and AI-assisted approaches, attendees will work on realistic scenarios that reinforce practical application of these fundamental principles while developing discernment about when and how to integrate AI tools into their workflow.",

This system ingests supplier audit findings and intelligently generates tailored Corrective Action Plans (CAPs). My role included designing the technical architecture, training and fine-tuning LLMs, integrating Apple’s audit standards into the system, and deploying the solution within Apple’s SupplierCare portal. I also built feedback loops and compliance review integrations to ensure high accuracy and learning over time.\r\n\r\nThis solution represents one of the first enterprise-scale applications of Generative AI specifically tailored for supply chain compliance workflows. Prior systems required heavy human intervention and manual documentation. By embedding a RAG-powered architecture that combines audit-specific retrieval with large language model reasoning, this project introduces a novel way to automate judgment-based compliance tasks — a space typically untouched by AI at scale. It is also designed to evolve into an intelligent audit expert, a rare implementation of self-improving GenAI in regulatory environments.",

        "description": "When someone says \"Java performance,\" most Java devs hear \"request latency\" and a large part of them say \"I'm already meeting my SLAs\" or \"my app isn't latency-sensitive.\" But Java performance has many more dimensions than that, and they matter for all kinds of Java apps—from ultra-low-latency FX trading platforms to long-running data ingestion jobs running at 2 AM on a Saturday.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll go beyond the basics to look at the full Java performance picture: median latencies, latency outliers, freezes, pauses, server max carrying capacity, how your app behaves when it first starts up, carbon footprint, and more. We'll check out the full landscape of tools at your disposal, from the newest JEPs in OpenJDK to GraalVM and Azul Platform Prime, and develop strategies to optimize whatever matters most to your team.",

But with so many options, the question is: which ones should we use today, which still matter, and which belong in the history books?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll explore the entire spectrum:\r\n* Classic Threads – the original concurrency primitive.\r\n* Parallel Streams – data parallelism for the collections era.\r\n* Futures & CompletableFuture – async results with callbacks and chaining.\r\n* Reactive Programming – backpressure, publishers, and the rise of frameworks like Reactor and RxJava.\r\n* Virtual Threads – Lightweight Concurrency Made Mainstream.\r\n* Structured Concurrency – Taming async chaos with lifetimes and scopes.\r\n* Vector API – data-level parallelism on modern CPUs.\r\n\r\nWe’ll also tackle the hard questions:\r\n* Do virtual threads really kill the need for reactive programming?\r\n* What do developers mean by “hidden stack traces,” and how do they impact debugging and profiling?\r\n* Where should you invest today, and what patterns should you abandon permanently?",

Those processes describe the delivery flow, the ability to go from requirements to working software and all of the SDLC steps in between. However, with the advent of LLMs now auto generating code, we have a maintenance issue wherein the knowledge of that code, the true usage of it and the optional semantic sugar sprinkled in becomes difficult to identify as time goes on. This gets greatly accelerated when the experience of the developer is simply not there. We always knew about Technical Debt, but are we prepared for the exponential rise in it as we embrace AI? Lean advocates for waste reduction, for a focus on standards, simplicity and the concept of value being added. This is a practice that software engineers simply have not been exposed to both in terms of how we write our code and how we protect our code equally.",

When you can more easily secure, upgrade, move, or modernize your code, that means you can adapt quickly and efficiently to changes in technology and markets. That’s what Migration Engineering is all about, which we’ll be exploring in this workshop.\r\n\r\nWe’ll discuss and demonstrate how to write custom recipes using OpenRewrite, an open source auto-refactoring tool that enables large-scale code analysis and transformations for your teams. You’ll learn the composition of recipes as we walk through a number of examples, then we’ll demonstrate how to write custom recipes using OpenRewrite. We will assemble these recipes with the visitor pattern, and show how to stitch recipes together with YAML, with Refaster-style templates, with Semgrep matchers, and more. We’ll also show how Generative AI can be applied to accelerate recipe development. \r\n\r\nThis is a comprehensive look at all kinds of recipe development that will enable you to come away fully equipped to plan and exercise large-scale code transformations in your organization.\r\n\r\nOutline\r\n\r\n* What is Migration Engineering?

But productionizing microservies is HARD. \r\n\r\nWhy can't we have our cake and eat it too? Turns out, we can. In this session we will explore the modular monolith—all the upsides of a monolith with none of the downsides of distributed architectures. We'll see what it means to build a modular monolith, and how that differs from a traditional layered architecture. We will discuss how we can build architectural governance to ensure our modules remain decoupled. Finally we'll see how our modules can communicate with one another without violating modularity. \r\n\r\nBy the end of this session you'll walk away with a greater appreciation for the monolith, and see how you can leverage this within your system architecture.

It ensures that privacy is not an afterthought, but a fundamental aspect of how systems and processes are built.\r\nBy systematically embedding privacy by design principles into DevSecOps, organizations can build more secure, compliant, and trustworthy applications and systems, ultimately benefiting both the business and its users.\r\nPrivacy by Design (PbD) is a fundamental approach to application security that ensures privacy is embedded into the design and architecture of IT systems, business practices, and networked infrastructure from the very beginning, rather than being an afterthought. It shifts the responsibility for data protection away from users and onto the organizations collecting, storing, and sharing the data.\r\n",

In this age of AI and other powerful tools why should a developer take the time to learn manual refactoring? Or even plan and execute their own novel refactorings? \r\n\r\nThis talk will delve into these questions with humor and the introduction of a novel refactoring. The new refactoring allows the developer to change the return type of a method without breaking the code even when the method is used many places.\r\n\r\nThe audience for this session are software developers and the people that interface with them (product owners, scrum masters, development managers) who need to know the value of this important and often neglected technical practice.\r\n \r\nAt the end of the session, the attendee will be able to identify hidden patterns in their code bases, plan a refactor effort on legacy codebases, write their own refactorings, and know when to use AI or other tools to perform the refactoring.\r\n",

Today, AI agents also need memory to be useful and reliable. They need to recall past events, connect knowledge, retrieve information quickly, and even forget the right things.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will look at the history of human memory and see what lessons it offers for AI. We will explore different types of memory:\r\n\r\n- Episodic memory for storing events and experiences\r\n- Semantic memory for facts and knowledge\r\n- Working memory for short-term reasoning\r\n- Vector or embedding memory for fast retrieval across large contexts\r\n\r\nWe will then see how each of these can be implemented in AI agents, what challenges arise, and what trade-offs we need to consider. The goal is to give you both inspiration from human history and concrete tools for building better agents with memory.",

As workloads expanded to include user-facing analytics, observability, and machine learning, the limitations of traditional monolithic architectures became apparent.\r\nThis talk examines the unbundling of the cloud data warehouse and the emergence of a modern data stack driven by open source technologies. We will discuss how databases like Postgres and ClickHouse, combined with open data lake standards such as Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Hudi, enable flexible, cost-effective, and high-performance solutions. By replacing traditional warehouses with composable and open architectures, organizations can build systems optimized for their specific real-time analytics and data processing needs.",

There are a host of new changes to discuss and in this talk we'll cover all the updates, why they happened and how they might impact you. We'll demo new features, including REST API versioning and Interface Clients (where you can quickly convert a Java interface into a fully-fledged HTTP client). Finally we'll look at what we're planning to deliver in 2026.",
