Actually, I am driven by complex challenges. I am most effective in up front project architecture, strategy, and planning, then leading projects to completion with the delivery teams. I enjoy building both technology strategy and the teams to provide effective results. I am seasoned in breaking down complex solutions and workloads into smaller and more manageable components.

However, the point being is that I have experienced the wrong and right ways to approach large solutions. I know to use what technology, where to use it, and the level of teams to get the job done most effectively. Also, I have learned from project mistakes and failures. I strive to iteratively improve myself, my teams, my projects ,and the organizations that I am working with.\r\n\r\nI am a humble technologist with a passion for serving my clients.
