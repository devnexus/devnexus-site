Over the years he’s seen his city experience corruption, flooding,  heartbreak, and most importantly, revived-determination.  “New Orleans doesn’t know how to quit,” Gant says, “that’s why I love it.” Gant firmly believes conflict abets passion, a fire always moves fastest uphill.\r\n \r\n\r\nAs CIO for the popular company Infinite Red, Gant works remotely from his home and uses his self-managed autonomy to explore a variety of leadership arts.  Besides managing the all-remote team from around the world, Gant has become a published author, adjunct professor, volunteer mentor, and a speaker at conferences worldwide.\r\n \r\n\r\nEach day, Gant refines what motivation and leadership mean as he strives to bridge the gap the theory and the concrete.  He voraciously consumes self-help books and online lectures, which he incorporates into his everyday processes.  Focus on personal enthusiasm and motivation to lead projects, workshops, and teams are the bedrock of success.  He refines these skills as often as possible at his local Toastmasters clubs, where he serves as Division Director.",

His approach to engineering leadership is deeply influenced by his lifelong passion for cricket, where he has observed how small behavioral changes in team dynamics can create meaningful performance improvements. He is constantly learning how to apply these insights to help software teams achieve sustainable results together.\r\n\r\nThrough both successes and failures in team building, Sandeep has discovered that the most impactful leadership often comes from asking better questions rather than having all the answers.
