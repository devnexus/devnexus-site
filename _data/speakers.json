    "bio": "The future of IT is in the AI innovations in the cloud. ☁️ My overall goal is to enable complex solutions to maximize the benefits and outcomes for organizations. Providing innovative solutions while controlling costs is my passion and highest value.\r\n\r\nI am an innovative thought leader that provides organizational leadership focused on taking on challenging initiatives. Actually, I am driven by complex challenges. I am most effective in up front project architecture, strategy, and planning, then leading projects to completion with the delivery teams. I enjoy building both technology strategy and the teams to provide effective results. I am seasoned in breaking down complex solutions and workloads into smaller and more manageable components. I can go on and on about common keywords here like domain driven design, microservices, design patterns, observability, cloud enablement, IaaS, PaaS, IaC, CaC, CI/CD, DevSecOps, automation, Azure, GCP, and AWS. However, the point being is that I have experienced the wrong and right ways to approach large solutions. I know to use what technology, where to use it, and the level of teams to get the job done most effectively. Also, I have learned from project mistakes and failures. I strive to iteratively improve myself, my teams, my projects ,and the organizations that I am working with.\r\n\r\nI am a humble technologist with a passion for serving my clients. I am the neighborhood and family \"IT Guy\". Also, I love to assist with local non-profits. I am a loving father with a wonderful wife and twin boys. Lastly, I am Linux hobbyist and huge into saltwater fishing.",

Besides managing the all-remote team from around the world, Gant has become a published author, adjunct professor, volunteer mentor, and a speaker at conferences worldwide.\r\n \r\n\r\nEach day, Gant refines what motivation and leadership mean as he strives to bridge the gap the theory and the concrete.  He voraciously consumes self-help books and online lectures, which he incorporates into his everyday processes.  Focus on personal enthusiasm and motivation to lead projects, workshops, and teams are the bedrock of success.  He refines these skills as often as possible at his local Toastmasters clubs, where he serves as Division Director.",
