				<p>Frequently deploying to production puts bigger pressure than before on DevOps to make sure the good, qualified application is provisioned with no mistakes.This session will explore some common pitfalls with traditional Continuous-Integration that increase risk, introduce manual input and human error, and generally make DevOps cringe before hitting the “deploy” button.</p><p>We will then demonstrate automation techniques that overcome these issues using popular tools, like Maven, Gradle, your CI server, custom scripts and a Binary Repository.<br/>Whether you are building software for the cloud or in-house, this presentation will show you how to have completely automated production builds that release applications which are fully traceable, managed and ready to be provisioned with no fear!</p>
