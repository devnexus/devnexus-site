    <div class="presentation-body">
      Apache NiFi is an open-source tool built to address the challenges of enterprise data flow. This talk will give an introduction to NiFi and discuss how it fits into the enterprise architecture. We’ll take a deep dive into NiFi’s core capabilities, such as visual command & control, routing & transformation, dynamic prioritization, back-pressure, and data provenance. We’ll give an overview of NiFi’s extension model which lets developers build their own custom components using Java, or JVM compatible scripting languages, and we’ll conclude by building an example data flow and discussing future work being done by the open-source community.
