    <div class="presentation-body">
      Throughout this talk, we will be looking into creating reactive pipelines using Akka in Scala. We will be looking at concepts such as futures, actors, routing. If we have time, we will bring in akka-camel and show how introducing tools such as RabbitMQ can push our designs into enterprise messaging. By the end of this session, you should be ready to begin implementing your own pipelines.
