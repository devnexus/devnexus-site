      GORM is the powerful ORM tool that has been developed as part of the Grails web framework. GORM fully leverages the capabilities of Groovy to provide a rich set of capabilities which greatly simplify interacting with databases from any JVM application, not just Groovy and Grails applications as recent versions of GORM are very easy to use independent of Grails.
