         <p>Roberto Cortez is a passionate  Java Developer with more than 10 years of experience; mainly the Finance sector. He is involved within the Open Source Community to help other individuals spread the knowledge about Java EE technologies.</p>

<p>He is a regular speaker at conferences like JavaOne, Devoxx, JFokus, and others, leads the Coimbra JUG and enjoys writing blog posts. He is very excited to be a Triber; he now has the opportunity to work on the servers where everything happens, instead of just developing applications that run in a container.</p>

<p>When he is not working, he hangs out with friends, play computer games and spends time with family.</p>

    <div class="presentation-body">
      I laugh at people that tell me that Java is slow, heavyweight and cumbersome. Maybe it was true when we had EJB2. I will prove to you that we can develop Enterprise Applications with just a few lines of code that can run in a Raspberry PI. If it runs in a PI, I think we can safely say it would run anywhere! To be able to do it, I'm going to use a new platform called Microprofile. Microprofile optimizes Enterprise Java for a Microservices Architecture and delivers application portability across multiple runtimes. You can use a subset of the Java EE specifications to develop Microprofile applications, with JAX-RS, CDI and JSON-P. Join me for this live coding session and help me spread the word that Java is actually great for the Enterprise.
