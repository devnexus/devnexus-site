    <div class="presentation-header">Java Microservices Patterns & Practices with Kubernetes/OpenShift and Istio</div>
    <div class="presentation-body">
      Already familiar with the Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts and features? Then you're ready for the next step! Now you need to learn how Kubernetes and a Service Mesh (Istio) can provide you out-of-box and transparently features like service discovery, load balancing, tracing, and circuit breaking. Without having to add a single line of code or @Annotation!

Come to this workshop to build your own small cluster of Java Microservices with Spring Boot and Eclipse Vert.x on top of Kubernetes/OpenShift and Istio. Then you will be able to unleash your developer powers on your project without having to worry too much with your infrastructure details anymore!

    <div class="presentation-body">
      The first generation of microservices was primarily shaped by Netflix OSS and leveraged by numerous Spring Cloud annotations all throughout your business logic. The next generation of microservices will leverage sidecars and a service mesh. In this session, we will give you a taste of Envoy and Istio, two open source projects that will change the way you write distributed, cloud native, Java applications on Kubernetes.  Traffic shaping, network fault-injection, A/B testing, dark launches and much more.
