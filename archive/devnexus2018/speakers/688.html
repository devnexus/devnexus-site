         <p>Iâ€™m a full stack developer who has been working with dynamic JVM languages and various JavaScript frameworks since 2004.  I started working with ColdFusion and graduated in 2011 to Groovy with Grails on the server side and has experience with everything from ExtJS to Knockout to AngularJS on the front end.</p>

    <div class="presentation-body">
      Gone are the days of verbose, cumbersome frameworks that get in your way! Spark Java is a micro framework that is easy to learn, simple to use and makes your job as a developer easier.  It can be used to create anything from a REST API microservice to a full featured web application.  You can write your application or microservice using pure Java, but development gets even easier when you combine it with a the JVM language that you are most comfortable with like Kotlin or Groovy (or others).  In this talk we'll take a look at using Spark Java with Groovy.  You'll learn the basics of Spark Java and get introduced to some ways it can be extended by integrating it with the larger Java ecosystem to do things like persistence with ORM and rendering views with a variety of templating engines available.  Spark Java is so lightweight you can even run it on a Raspberry Pi!
