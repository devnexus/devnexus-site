         <p>Ben Hale leads Pivotalâ€™s efforts to constantly improve the Java experience on Cloud Foundry. Recently he has been working on the Cloud Foundry Java Buildpack with an eye to making it the best place to run Java applications, in the Cloud or otherwise. In addition, he leads the team that is revamping the Cloud Foundry Java Client, a Java language binding on top of the Cloud Foundry REST APIs.</p>

<p>Prior to working on Cloud Foundry, Ben worked on large-scale middleware management tools, tc Server, dm Server (OSGi), and Spring. If you go back far enough, he even worked on a network management and monitoring application, but will deny it when asked.</p>

    <div class="presentation-body">
      Spring Boot 2 and Spring Framework 5 have arrived and they deliver on a key promise: Supporting Reactive programming using Reactor 3.1 to model non-blocking flows. 

More than learning about a new framework, the developer is challenged with a new mindset. In this Workshop, we aim to deliver the survival kit to understand reactive programming trade-off, when to choose it and read/write Reactor flows. In the context of Spring Boot 2, we'll be exploring some of the ecosystem support like web, data and security.
