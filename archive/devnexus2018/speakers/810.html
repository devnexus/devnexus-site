    <div class="presentation-body">
      Using SSL/TLS the right way is often a big hurdle for developers. We prefer to have that one colleague perform "something with certificates", because he/she knows how that works. But what if "that one colleague" is enjoying vacation and something goes wrong with the certificates?
 
In this session we'll take a close look at secure communication at the transport level. Starting with what exactly SSL and TLS is, we'll dive into public/private keys, and signing. We'll also learn what all this has to do with an unfortunate Dutch notary. Of course, there'll be plenty of practical tips & trics, as well as demo's. 
 
Attend this session to become "that one colleague"!
