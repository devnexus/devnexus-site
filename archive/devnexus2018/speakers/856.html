    <div class="presentation-body">
      While application architectures are evolving to become stateless, application state and state management are naturally emerging as a service in themselves. This session outlines the development, operation, and maintenance of an application state service for the cloud with Java 9, using a serverless strategy. The presentation investigates some of the challenges of designing an infinite-capacity, infinite-processing platform capable of reliably running everything from the smallest application to a globally distributed enterprise-class infrastructure for the mobile and IoT domains.
