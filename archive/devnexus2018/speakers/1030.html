      How would you feel if you knew that any pat of the code was at most a few minutes away from being shippable and delivered into production? How would you feel if you knew that any part of the code is a few ctrl+z's away from being shippable and delivered into production? Emboldened and confident? Test driven development (TDD) gives you that. TDD allows you to proceed with confidence that you're building the right thing. It provides you with imminent-horizons that you can meet and measure. TDD gives developers the confidence to go faster, secure in the knowledge that what they break they will fix and be able to improve. In this talk, join Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long (@starbuxman) as he looks at how to test Spring applications and services. We'll look at how to test basic components, mocks, how to take advantage of test slices, and how to test web applications. We'll also look at how to ensure that API producers and API consumers work well together using consumer driven contract testing (CDCT) without sacrificing the testing pyramid for end-to-end integration tests.

      Spring Boot, the convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring's flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development on the JVM not just fly, but pleasant! Spring Boot aims to make address the common functional and non-functional requirements that gate quickly moving to production. The framework is as clean as it gets, wouldn't it be nice if the language matched its elegance?

Kotlin, the productivity-focused language from our friends at JetBrains, takes up the slack to make the experience leaner, cleaner and even more pleasant!

The Spring and Kotlin teams have worked hard to make sure that Kotlin and Spring Boot are a first-class experience for all developers trying to get to production, faster and safer. Come for the Spring and stay for the Bootiful Kotlin.
