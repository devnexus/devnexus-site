    <div class="presentation-body">
      Some concepts are evergreen: should be discussed ever and ever again! Events are one of them: once you shape your mind around events, messaging becomes an essential asset in your toolbox. Using an Event-Driven Architecture on top of a Message-Driven Architecture allow us to truly unleash the benefits of distributed computing.

Deep dive with us on this tutorial where we'll cover events, message-oriented middleware, CQRS, event sourcing, JMS, Apache Kafka, data streaming, and analytics to teach you how the fundamentals on how to create a distributed, resilient, and scalable application. You'll learn that events and messaging are not hard: it's just that they never taught you how to do it properly!
