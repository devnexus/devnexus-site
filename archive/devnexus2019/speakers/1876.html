         <p>Erin Schnabel is a Senior Technical Staff Member at IBM working with microservice architectures, cloud native applications, composable runtimes and Java. Erin has 20 years under her belt, as a developer, technical leader, architect and evangelist. She is passionate about developer experience, particularly with how the evolving cloud ecosystem impacts developers and their applications. She prefers learning (and teaching) by doing, as demonstrated by her open source exploits with “Game On!” (gameontext.org), a text adventure game that provides developers with a playground to experimenting with backend technologies.</p>

    <div class="presentation-body">
      Modern Cloud Native applications are not composed of a single language, or runtime. There are often local standards and requirements for individual services, intended to allow the application as a whole to be properly managed, and secure. In this talk, Erin and Ozzy will discuss what it means to be a Spring application in a polyglot environment, with a focus on interoperable security, logging, metrics, and including a brief boat trip to view the architectural considerations for a Spring Cloud application on Kubernetes.
