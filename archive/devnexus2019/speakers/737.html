    <div class="presentation-body">
      Microprofile is a breath of fresh air in the Enterprise Java world. But is it fit to the Cloud? We believe it is! Come to this session and see how we can successfully develop/integrate/deploy a Microprofile application on top of the Azure cloud computing platform. Weâ€™ll cover it all: metrics, tracing, health checks, security, and deployment pipelines. Because Microprofile belongs in your code, but it needs to be leverage by many other services provided by your platform.
