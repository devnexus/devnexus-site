    <div class="presentation-body">
      Reactive Applications require non-blocking database access; the existing JDBC API leads to blocked threads, threads scheduling, and contention. 
For high throughput and large-scale deployment, the Java community needs a standard asynchronous API for database access where user threads never block. 
This session presents a new Java standard proposal for accessing SQL databases. 
This new API is completely non-blocking. It is not intended to be an extension to, or a replacement for, JDBC but, rather, an entirely separate API that provides completely non-blocking access to the same databases as JDBC.  This presentation examines the API, its execution model, lot of code samples, and the next steps.
