    <div class="presentation-body">
      The software development ecosystem exists in a state of dynamic equilibrium, where any new tool, framework, or technique leads to disruption and the establishment of a new equilibrium. Predictability is impossible when the foundation architects plan against changes constantly in unexpected ways. Instead, prefer evolvability over predictability. This hands-on workshop provides a high-level overview of a different way to think about software architecture.

    <div class="presentation-body">
      The perceptions of Evolutionary Architecture have progressed rapidly from something considered heretical to something considered essential yet challenging. The shift has resulted from changes in both the business climate with its need for rapid innovation and the supporting technology that makes Evolutionary Architecture feasible. Describing these changes sets up a discussion about the mechanics of implementing an evolutionary architecture. We'll particularly focus on the central role of fitness functions in driving the architecture in the desired direction and how techniques such as refactoring databases and continuous delivery support architectural evolution. We'll close by looking at what the future holds.
