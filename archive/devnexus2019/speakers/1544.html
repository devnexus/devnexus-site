      Let’s face it, REST APIs can be problematic, and hypermedia hasn’t quite proven to be the answer we’ve looked for. GraphQL has quickly become more popular offering a solution to the problems REST created – but opens back up the very problems REST was created to avoid (remember SOAP?). But what if there was a way to take the best of both: enter API chains. In this session we’ll take a look at the pros and cons of REST, GraphQL, and a new specification and library for chaining numerous resource calls into a single HTTP request.

      Building an API is easy. Designing an API is hard. That's the motto of Undisturbed REST: a guide to designing the perfect API, and the book used by many of today's top enterprises to answer key questions and build a sustainable, efficient API that lasts. In this session we'll jump right in, tackling the questions you need to answer, looking at how to design your API, and learning from real examples in the field. And as a special bonus, each participant will receive a complimentary PDF version of the book to dig in and continue learning with.
