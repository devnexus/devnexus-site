      One of key pillars of the Java language strength is the Java Virtual Machine - with its openness to other languages, it allows developers to choose the right tool for their job and still benefit from the rich Java ecosystem. This led to the creation of many different languages in the past years, with some languages getting more attention and traction than others. Still, most Java developers don’t use or have ever tried anything besides the “plain old Java”! In this talk, we’ll show how these languages compare regarding syntax, target use cases and projects that use them. This will help you expand your tool set and choose the right language for your next essay!
