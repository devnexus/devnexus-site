    <div class="presentation-body">
      This talk will introduce you to Visual Thinking Strategies (or VTS) - an activity that can help get the most from every member of your agile team. VTS develops critical thinking skills by viewing and discussing works of art in a group. By allowing individuals to talk about art - without needing a background in the field - VTS advances skills such as: Observing, Brainstorming, Speculating, Reasoning with Evidence, Cultivating a Point of View, and Revision & Elaboration.
