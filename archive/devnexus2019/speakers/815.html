    <div class="presentation-body">
      Cloud-native. It's a great term, one that promises significant benefits for Java developers and Java applications. However there are traps for the unwary traveller undertaking this journey. It's best to be prepared and forewarned. In this talk hear more about what cloud-native Java looks like, and how it can differ from what you might be expecting.

From application to JVM to hosting environment, there are challenges to face and obstacles to overcome before you've reached your goal. This talk will educate and remind you of the important points to be aware of, and will offer an opinionated view of the open technologies you should be including in your travel bag.

Whether a new starter or an old hand, this session will leave you thinking differently about cloud-native Java!

(Note: this talk may contain MicroProfile or OpenJ9 )

    <div class="presentation-header">Hands-on cloud-native Java with MicroProfile, Kubernetes and Istio</div>
    <div class="presentation-body">
      Ever wondered what makes a cloud-native application "cloud-native"? Ever wondered what the unique challenges are and how best to address them on fully-open Java technologies? In this workshop, you'll learn what it means to be cloud-native and how that impacts application development. You'll learn about Eclipse MicroProfile, an industry collaboration defining technologies for the development and management of cloud-native microservices. With a full set of MicroProfile workshop modules available to you, you'll be able to start with the basics of REST services and progress to more advanced topics, or you can jump right in and develop secure, fault tolerant, configurable and monitorable microservices.

Once you've developed your microservice, you'll learn how to package it in a Docker container and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster. Finally, you'll learn the role of a service mesh and use Istio to manage your microservice interactions.
