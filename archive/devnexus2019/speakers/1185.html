      We know that different business needs or standards drive towards one technology or another, but how can we truly know which is the best technology for the job?
In this session, we will learn how different data sources and a variety of query languages impact the amount of code required to store and retrieve data. From relational to NoSQL to graph, we will explore various types of data - the way it is stored underneath and how best to go about retrieving it. A live-coding demo will bring all this to life, as the presenter shows exactly how your database choices change how you write applications.
Come to this session to find out whether the solution actually fits the need, and if it doesn’t, how to provide valuable criteria and reasoning for a change!
