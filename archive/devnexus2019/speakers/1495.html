    <div class="presentation-body">
      In this talk, I'm going to explain how WebAssembly works and how to use it. I'll cover what it is, how it fits into your application, and how to build and use your own WebAssembly modules. And, I'll demo how to build and use those modules with both Rust and the WebAssembly Text Format. That's right, I'll be live coding in an assembly language.
