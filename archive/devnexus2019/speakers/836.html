    <div class="presentation-body">

Your future cloud native applications will consist of both microservces and functions, often wrapped as Linux containers, but in many cases where you the developer ignore the operational aspects of managing that infrastructure.

In this session, we will be diving into Knative as serverless "base primitives" for Kubernetes.
