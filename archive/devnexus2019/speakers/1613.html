    <div class="presentation-body">
      Modern Cloud Native applications are not composed of a single language, or runtime. There are often local standards and requirements for individual services, intended to allow the application as a whole to be properly managed, and secure. In this talk, Erin and Ozzy will discuss what it means to be a Spring application in a polyglot environment, with a focus on interoperable security, logging, metrics, and including a brief boat trip to view the architectural considerations for a Spring Cloud application on Kubernetes.
