      For many, serverless computing is the natural progression of the microservice philosophy. In this talk we’ll take a look at what that is and the benefits of going serverless. We’ll see how you can get started writing, testing, and deploying your functions on top of Apache OpenWhisk. We will see examples using several different programming languages. This talk will attempt to cover the very latest developments in this rapidly changing emerging field.
