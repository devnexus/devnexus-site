    <div class="presentation-header">Micronaut: The New Wiz on the Block</div>
    <div class="presentation-body">
      As we head into the third decade of the 21st century, the demands on applications are vastly different than the past. We need speed, performance, efficiency, smaller footprint, and at the same time, ease of development. Micronaut is a new library that has been designed from the scratch to provide just that. In this presentation we'll learn about Micronaut, what it is useful for, and how to quickly build RESTful services and applications with it.

    <div class="presentation-body">
      If you’re developing with Kotlin or getting started with the language, come to this talk to find out how to program your Micronaut application with Kotlin. Kotlin brings a variety of interesting features for fluency, type safety, and asynchronous programming. Learn how to leverage those capacities of the language in the context of Micronaut.

    <div class="presentation-header">Applying Design Patterns</div>
    <div class="presentation-body">
      Learning about design patterns is not really hard. Using design patterns is also not that hard. But, using the right design pattern for the right problem is not that easy. If instead of looking for a pattern to use if we decide to look for the design force behind a problem it may lead to better solutions. Furthermore, with most mainstream languages supporting lambda expressions and functional style, the patterns appear in so many more elegant ways as well.

In this workshop we will start with a quick introduction of a few patterns. Then we will work with multiple examples—take a problem, delve into the design, and as we solve it, see what patterns emerge in the design. The objective of this workshop is to get a hands on experience to prudently identify and use patterns that help create extensible code.

    <div class="presentation-header">Mixed Paradigm: the method to madness</div>
    <div class="presentation-body">
      Language Paradigms are intriguing, some languages are pure and enforce a particular paradigm, and yet some languages are hybrid. A single paradigm language is consistent, easier to use, and often favored by the proponents of the promoted paradigm. Hybrid languages often appear confusing, seem harder to use, and yet there are so many of them. From the programming point of view should we stick to one paradigm or should we dabble into the mixed paradigm arena? It turns out, that is not an easy question.
