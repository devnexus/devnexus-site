In his Devnexus presentation, **Michael Redlich** provides a comprehensive look at **Jakarta EE 11**, the latest evolution of the platform formerly known as Java EE. He begins with a brief history, tracing Jakarta EE from its origins in the late 1990s through its donation to the Eclipse Foundation and subsequent rebranding. Redlich emphasizes the platformâ€™s flexibility, offering multiple profiles for different development needs: the **full Platform Profile**, the **Web Profile** for web-focused applications, and the **Core Profile**, a streamlined subset designed specifically for microservices and cloud-native runtimes.

The talk dives into the key updates and features that make Jakarta EE 11 a modern choice for developers. Notable additions include the **Jakarta Data specification**, which simplifies database access, and support for **Java records** integrated across specifications like Expression Language and Jakarta Persistence. Performance enhancements include the use of **virtual threads from JDK 21** within Jakarta Concurrency, enabling scalable, concurrent applications with minimal code changes. Security is also improved with the new **JWT Bridge**, while deprecated features such as the security manager are removed to streamline development.

Redlich rounds out the presentation with a practical demonstration of a "beer database" application, showing how Jakarta Data works seamlessly with MongoDB to simplify data access without complex configuration. He also highlights other updates, such as replacing legacy `java.util.Date` with the modern Java Time API and validating records with Jakarta Validation. The talk makes it clear that **Jakarta EE 11 is actively modernizing**, providing developers with a simplified, powerful foundation for building scalable, cloud-native Java applications.
