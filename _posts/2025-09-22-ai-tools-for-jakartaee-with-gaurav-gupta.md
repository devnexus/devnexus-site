In his Devnexus presentation, **Gaurav Gupta**, senior software engineer at Payara explored how **AI tools are transforming Jakarta EE development**. He began by addressing the limitations of traditional approaches—project generators, visual designers, and IDE autocompletion—which, while helpful, often lack context awareness and require significant manual customization. Gupta argued that by embedding Large Language Models (LLMs) into development workflows, developers can move past repetitive tasks and focus on solving real business problems and building innovative features.

Gupta introduced two standout AI-powered tools that streamline Jakarta EE development. The first is **Payara Starter**, a generative AI tool for designing Jakarta EE applications. With just a high-level description like *“Devnexus conference”*, Para Starter generates a complete **Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram**, including entities such as “Conference” and “Attendees.” Developers can then refine the design using natural language prompts, expanding or simplifying it as requirements evolve. Beyond schema design, Payara Starter also generates web component details like titles, descriptions, and icons, giving developers a dynamically built application foundation tailored to their input.

The second tool is the **Jeddict AI Assistant for Apache NetBeans IDE**, a free and open-source plugin. Jeddict adds powerful features such as **context-aware chat** at both project and package levels, AI-driven inline completion, and intelligent SQL inline completion. Gupta demonstrated how it can suggest relevant code snippets, improve variable and method naming, generate clear log messages and detailed Javadoc, and even create test cases to strengthen coverage. One of its most innovative capabilities is context-aware database chat, where developers can interact with their database schema using natural language and instantly import generated code into their project. These capabilities enable Jakarta EE developers to **“code smarter, not harder”**, boosting productivity and improving overall software quality.



Gupta’s talk makes it clear that the future of Jakarta EE lies not only in frameworks and specifications but also in the **AI-assisted tooling that empowers developers**. By embracing tools like Payara Starter and Jeddict, teams can accelerate delivery, reduce repetitive effort, and create cleaner, more maintainable applications.
