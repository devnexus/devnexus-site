\# The CFP for Devnexus 2026 is open!

\## Submit your ideas before September 15

The call for papers for Devnexus 2026 is now open. Key details:

\- Location: Atlanta, GA, USA

\- Workshop day: March 4

\- JUG Leaders Summit & JC Summit: March 4

\- Main Conference day: March 5,6

\- Speaker/JUG Leader day: March 7 (TBD)

This year's event is a little different than previous years. We have the conference split into three major themes with tracks for each of them, and there are fewer tracks:

\- AI

- Generative AI

- AI Engineering and Infrastructure

- AI in Practice (dev and non-dev)

\- Java

-   Core Java

-   Java Frameworks and Ecosystem

\- Dev Practices

- Tech Leadership

- Architecture

- Tools and Security

Please choose your track wisely, and we may move your session from the track you selected to another track for program fit.

\## Workshop ideas

We're looking for topical hands-on workshops for the conference. All workshops are full day (8 hours, 6 hours of content). You can look at the list of tracks above to get an idea of what we're looking for - remember that our audience is generally Enterprise Java developers/architects/managers/executives - but we are open to other workshops that will resonate with our attendees. Please choose the "keynote" track when submitting these.

\## Logistics

Our goal is to inform speakers by October 15. If your session is selected, please promptly confirm your participation by clicking the CONFIRM button in the email you get. We may also do some late selection after the first round! Final program will be set around mid November.

We have limited budget for travel and hotel coverage for speakers. Please indicate if you need this when submitting.

We encourage you to stay at the conference hotel; once we send out the CFP notifications we'll send you the booking link for our conference room block at the AC HOTEL DOWNTOWN ATLANTA.
