**What makes software projects succeed‚Äîor fail‚Äîhas less to do with code and more to do with people.** In this session, Nathaniel Schutta unpacks the human side of software engineering and why mastering influence, communication, and culture can make or break your next big project.

In his talk on the people-centric side of software engineering, Nathaniel Schutta, Technical Director at ThoughtWorks, reminds us that building software is never just about writing code‚Äîit‚Äôs about working with people. He argues that the real success of a project depends on communication, influence, and cultural awareness just as much as technical ability. One striking example he shares is how reframing a $2 million technical investment as a $20 million business opportunity changed the conversation entirely, underscoring how storytelling and framing often carry more weight than raw technical merit.

Schutta goes on to explore how company culture shapes what‚Äôs technically possible. A culture that resists change can quietly derail even the best ideas, with subtle signals‚Äîlike dress codes‚Äîhinting at deeper organizational inertia. Since developers rarely hold the authority to force change, he encourages them to focus on influence instead: make others feel ownership of new ideas, pitch changes as safe experiments, and build alliances with people who hold sway. These practical strategies shift the balance from frustration to forward momentum.

The talk closes with a call for simplicity and knowledge sharing as the backbone of resilient engineering culture. Schutta distinguishes between essential complexity‚Äîthe unavoidable challenges of a problem‚Äîand accidental complexity that developers introduce themselves. To minimize the latter, he emphasizes clear documentation and humane interfaces for collaboration, such as onboarding guides and architectural decision records. Ultimately, he stresses that many failures stem not from code, but from misconceptions and miscommunication. The takeaway: strong communication, shared understanding, and simplicity are just as crucial to engineering success as any technical skill.
