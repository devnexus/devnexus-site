Write your content **The creator of the Spring Framework, Rod Johnson, will deliver a keynote** and a session at Devnexus 2026 and the AI Leader Summit!

**Keynote - Its Up To Java Developers to Fix Enterprise AI**<br>Enterprise GenAI often fails because it’s built as a disconnected system rather than integrated into existing applications and domain models. This keynote calls for a shift toward JVM-based, production-ready agentic AI, leveraging proven Java practices such as domain-driven design, structured, type-safe agents, and testable workflows. Rod Johnson shows how domain-anchored agents, precise tool methods, and agentic RAG can turn enterprise data into real intelligence, arguing that modern Java and Spring are uniquely positioned to move AI from fragile prototypes to scalable, reliable production systems.here using either markdown or html
