title: Runtime Efficiencies and Spring Boot with DaShaun Carter

In his Devnexus session, **DaShaun Carter**, Spring Developer Advocate, tackled one of the most urgent challenges in modern Java development: cloud runtime efficiency. For years, Javaâ€”and by extension, Spring Bootâ€”has faced criticism for slow startup times and heavy memory consumption. In todayâ€™s pay-per-millisecond cloud economy, those inefficiencies translate directly into inflated costs and scalability limits. Carter captured this impact with a striking metric: even shaving latency from two milliseconds to one could **double a companyâ€™s revenue**. The question for developers is no longer just *can Spring run in the cloud*, but *how efficiently can it run there*?

Carterâ€™s approach centers on enabling developers to do **more with less**, optimizing performance without sacrificing productivity. The journey begins with simple but high-impact steps. Upgrading from older Java versions like 8 to modern LTS releases such as 17 or 21 can cut memory usage by up to 50%, thanks to years of JVM-level improvements. From there, developers can unlock deeper performance gains through **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) processing** and **Class Data Sharing (CDS)**. AOT pre-generates configuration and reflection data at build time, removing runtime lag, while CDS speeds up subsequent starts by caching class data across runs. For the ultimate optimization, **GraalVM Native Images** take this furtherâ€”compiling Java apps into standalone executables that start almost instantly and consume a fraction of the memory. In Carterâ€™s demonstration, the shift from a traditional JVM image (166 MB) to a native image (11 MB) underscored just how dramatic these savings can be.

The key takeaway is both practical and empowering: **the Java of today is fast, efficient, and cloud-ready**. Developers are encouraged to measure and prove these improvements using Spring Bootâ€™s built-in Actuator metricsâ€”benchmarking startup times and memory usage before and after each optimization. By automating builds with **Cloud Native Buildpacks**, teams can eliminate manual Dockerfile management and take advantage of multi-architecture support, AOT processing, and GraalVM optimizations out-of-the-box. Carter closed his session with a strong message: by combining JVM advancements, AOT, and native execution, Spring Boot developers can achieve **up to 70% reductions in infrastructure costs**, transforming Java from a perceived heavyweight into a model of efficiency for the cloud-native era.
