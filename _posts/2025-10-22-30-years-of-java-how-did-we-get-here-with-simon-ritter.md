In his Devnexus session celebrating three decades of Java, **Simon Ritter**—Deputy CTO at Azul Systems—explored how one of the world’s most influential programming languages became a global standard not by chance, but by perfect timing and strategic design. Ritter reminded developers that Java was never about disruption for its own sake; it was about solving practical problems elegantly. Originally conceived in 1991 under *Project Green* at Sun Microsystems, Java’s creators, led by James Gosling, set out to design a language for interactive consumer devices. By borrowing the best ideas of its predecessors—object-oriented programming from **Simula 67**, garbage collection from **Lisp**, and a familiar **C-like syntax**—they built a platform that was familiar yet forward-thinking. The pivotal moment came in 1994 with the demo of the *HotJava* browser, which showcased Java’s ability to deliver dynamic, secure applications across the emerging World Wide Web. From that moment, Java’s promise to “**write once, run anywhere**” became more than a slogan—it became the foundation of the Internet age.

Ritter traced Java’s rapid rise through both innovation and necessary governance. Early on, disputes such as the high-profile lawsuit against Microsoft over incompatible Java implementations highlighted the risk of fragmentation. The solution was the **Java Community Process (JCP)**, launched in 1999 to formalize how the platform evolved. Through **Java Specification Requests (JSRs)** and the **Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)**, the community ensured that every implementation stayed true to the “run anywhere” philosophy. This system laid the groundwork for open collaboration, culminating in the **OpenJDK** project in 2006—ushering in an era of transparency and shared innovation. Ritter emphasized Java’s unmatched versatility, noting its footprint across every scale of computing: from the **Java Card** powering SIM cards and smart passes, to **enterprise backends**, **cloud infrastructure**, and even **IoT devices** like the Kindle. Each major release has reflected thoughtful evolution rather than revolution—from the introduction of **Generics in JDK 5** to **Lambdas and Streams in JDK 8**, and more recently, **Virtual Threads** and **Pattern Matching** that streamline concurrency and logic for modern workloads.

The enduring lesson for developers, Ritter argued, is that Java’s success has always been rooted in pragmatism and community. James Gosling once called it a “**blue-collar programming language**,” built to get the job done efficiently—and that spirit still defines it today. With a steady six-month release cadence, Java continues to evolve in a way that keeps it relevant without breaking the past, offering continuous value to developers across every industry. Ritter’s closing message was clear: the next 30 years of Java depend on active participation. Joining **Java User Groups (JUGs)**, contributing to the **JCP**, or attending community events like **Devnexus** ensures that Java remains as adaptable, secure, and innovative as ever—a language not frozen in history, but constantly rewriting the future.
