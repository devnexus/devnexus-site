\# Maven 4: A New Era of Simpler Builds

&nbsp;

\*\*Apache Maven 4\*\* marks a significant step forward in simplifying the build process for Java developers, directly addressing several long-standing frustrations from Maven 3. In his Devnexus presentation, Java Champion and Maven contributor \*\*Chandra Guntur\*\* highlighted key improvements that streamline dependency management, clarify project structure, and ultimately make builds more predictable. The core message is clear: Maven 4 isnâ€™t just an updateâ€”itâ€™s a re-imagination of how we handle multi-module projects and plugin management.

&nbsp;

One of the most impactful changes in Maven 4 is the elegant solution to a major pain point: \*\*versioning in multi-module projects\*\*. Unlike Maven 3, which often required third-party plugins to manage versions in CI/CD pipelines, Maven 4 introduces a \*\*native \`$revision\` variable\*\*. This built-in feature simplifies aligning versions across sub-modules without external tools. Another major improvement is the \*\*separation of concerns with two distinct POM files\*\*: \`build.pom\` and \`consumer.pom\`. This ensures that only essential information is published to a repository, preventing extraneous build data from polluting the final artifact and providing a cleaner experience for anyone consuming your library.

&nbsp;

Beyond these foundational changes, Maven 4 introduces several \*\*quality-of-life improvements\*\* that lead to more robust builds. It now automatically imports versions for sibling module dependencies, eliminating the need for manual declarations. To prevent unexpected build failures, Maven 4 warns developers when a plugin version isnâ€™t locked downâ€”a silent issue that often plagued Maven 3. It also clarifies dependency management with a dedicated \*\*Bill of Materials (BOM) packaging\*\*, making BOMs easier to identify and use correctly. Together, these features make Maven 4 a compelling upgrade for any developer seeking a more efficient and reliable build system.
