					The Atlanta Java Users Group (AJUG) is committed to protecting the privacy of your
					personal information. This Policy explains how we gather and use the information
					that we collect during and after registration for DevNexus. This policy may change
					over time. Amendments to this statement will be posted at http://devnexus.com
					and will be effective when posted. Your continued use of this site following the
					posting of any amendment, modification or change shall constitute your acceptance
					thereof.
				</p>

				<h2>Registration</h2>

				<p>
					During the registration process for DevNexus, AJUG will collect the following
					personal information about you name, email address company and t-shirt size. This
					information will be used for DevNexus registration
				</p>

				<h2>Communications</h2>

				<p>
					AJUG occasionally will contact registrants signed up for DevNexus with email
					updates for the current or future conference. Registrants can opt-out of such
					communications at any time by contacting us or by using the unsubscribe link.
				</p>
				<p>
					In certain circumstances, we may share your contact information with sponsors but
					only if you have agreed to this during the registration process. Your name badge for
					the event will contain a QR code that has your name and email address on it. If, at
					DevNexus, a sponsor asks to scan that code it is completely your decision to allow
					them to do that. We also may provide information to regulatory authorities and
					law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law or when we otherwise
					believe in good faith that the law requires it. We do not sell, rent, or share personal
					information or e-mail addresses with external organizations or individuals.
				</p>

				<h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>

				<p>
					AJUG may work with other companies’ websites to perform functions on our behalf.
					Examples include DevNexus registration, sending e-mail, and processing credit
					card payments. They have access to personal information needed to perform their
					functions, and this is subject to their privacy policies. AJUG is not responsible for the
					privacy practices or the content of such websites. If you want to know the privacy
					policies of the other websites, please refer to the organization sponsoring such
					website.
				</p>

				<h2>Conference Sponsor Sites</h2>

				<p>
					This website contains links to conference sponsors websites. DevNexus sponsors
					are responsible for their own policies and procedures. Review the sponsor’s policy
					regarding their privacy policy. AJUG is not responsible for products and services
					transactions that are consummated at third party websites.
				</p>

				<h2>Consent</h2>

				<p>
					By registering for conference updates or signing up for the conference, you
					expressly consent to the collection and use by AJUG of personally identifiable
					information according to this Privacy Policy. During the registration there is an
					option for you to agree that DevNexus sponsors may send you information and
					services that they think will be useful to you.
				</p>

				<h2>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</h2>

				<p>
					If you choose to attend DevNexus your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject
					to this notice, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and
					application of the law of the state of Georgia. If you have any concern about privacy
					at DevNexus, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to
					resolve it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice will change also. We may
					e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed
					us not to, but you should check our website frequently to see recent changes.
					Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that
					we have about you. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will
					never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective
					of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected
					customers
				</p>

				<h2>Opting Out of Receiving Communications</h2>

				<p>
					You may opt-out of receiving communications from AJUG by sending an email to
					<strong>info [at] ajug dot org</strong>
