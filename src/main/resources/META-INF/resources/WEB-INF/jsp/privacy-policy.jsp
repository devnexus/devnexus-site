    <h1 class="featured-header">Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        The Atlanta Java Users Group (AJUG) is committed to protecting the privacy of your
        personal information. This Policy explains how we gather and use the information
        that we collect during and after registration for DevNexus. This policy may change
        over time. Amendments to this statement will be posted at http://devnexus.com
        and will be effective when posted. Your continued use of this site following the
        posting of any amendment, modification or change shall constitute your acceptance
        thereof.
    </p>

    <h2>Registration</h2>

    <p>
        During the registration process for DevNexus, AJUG will collect the following
        personal information about you name, email address company and t-shirt size. This
        information will be used for DevNexus registration
    </p>

    <h2>Communications</h2>

    <p>
        AJUG occasionally will contact registrants signed up for DevNexus with email
        updates for the current or future conference. Registrants can opt-out of such
        communications at any time by contacting us or by using the unsubscribe link.
    </p>
    <p>
        In certain circumstances, we may share your contact information with sponsors but
        only if you have agreed to this during the registration process. Your name badge for
        the event will contain a QR code that has your name and email address on it. If, at
        DevNexus, a sponsor asks to scan that code it is completely your decision to allow
        them to do that. We also may provide information to regulatory authorities and
        law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law or when we otherwise
        believe in good faith that the law requires it. We do not sell, rent, or share personal
        information or e-mail addresses with external organizations or individuals.
    </p>

    <h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>

    <p>
        AJUG may work with other companies’ websites to perform functions on our behalf.
        Examples include DevNexus registration, sending e-mail, and processing credit
        card payments. They have access to personal information needed to perform their
        functions, and this is subject to their privacy policies. AJUG is not responsible for the
        privacy practices or the content of such websites. If you want to know the privacy
        policies of the other websites, please refer to the organization sponsoring such
        website.
    </p>

    <h2>Conference Sponsor Sites</h2>

    <p>
        This website contains links to conference sponsors websites. DevNexus sponsors
        are responsible for their own policies and procedures. Review the sponsor’s policy
        regarding their privacy policy. AJUG is not responsible for products and services
        transactions that are consummated at third party websites.
    </p>

    <h2>Consent</h2>

    <p>
        By registering for conference updates or signing up for the conference, you
        expressly consent to the collection and use by AJUG of personally identifiable
        information according to this Privacy Policy. During the registration there is an
        option for you to agree that DevNexus sponsors may send you information and
        services that they think will be useful to you.
    </p>

    <h2>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</h2>

    <p>
        If you choose to attend DevNexus your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject
        to this notice, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and
        application of the law of the state of Georgia. If you have any concern about privacy
        at DevNexus, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to
        resolve it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice will change also. We may
        e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed
        us not to, but you should check our website frequently to see recent changes.
        Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that
        we have about you. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will
        never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective
        of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected
        customers
    </p>
