            <h4>
                We make that determination on a case-by-case basis. For speakers
                that are not affiliated with large organizations, we often do.
                However, if you represent a larger organization we typically don't.
                The reason is that we need to carefully watch our budget as we
                operate as non-profit and keep the ticket prices as low as possible.
                As we grow, we started to loosen the restrictions a bit but
                we rather still do the determination on a case by case basis.
