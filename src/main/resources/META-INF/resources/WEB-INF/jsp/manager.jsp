                        <ol>
                            <li><p>Stack exposure. At DEVNEXUS we don't just look at the full stack, but all the

                                    possibilities. You'll find out which technologies work best together and which have the

                                    capabilities you need. Learn from experts--see examples, learn from their mistakes, ask

                                    questions in person, and benefit from their wisdom. You'll be exposed to different stacks,

                                    get to test drive features, learn other programming paradigms, and walk away with a list

                                    of new strategies and tools to try back in the workplace.</p></li>

                            <li><p>Tracks. With DEVNEXUS's track based format, you can tackle your most pressing

                                    problems. Are you focusing on performance? Developing a game plan for mobile?

                                    Needing to scale your web application for the next 10,000 to 1,000,000 customers? We

                                    address some of the most common and complex problems software engineers face and

                                    give you ideas and solutions you can take back with you to fix it.</p></li>

                            <li><p>Uninterrupted focus. It's a huge advantage to be away from work and constant

                                    interruptions, acquiring the knowledge you need to move projects forward. At

                                    DEVNEXUS, you can ask questions, compare notes with fellow attendees, and immerse

                                    yourself in the subject matter you've set out to learn. And with a one day

                                    workshop/training day, you can delve as deeply into a topic as you need to.</p></li>

                            <li><p>Stay current. Technology changes fast. Keep pace with new developments, best

                                    practices, products, services, and trends at DEVNEXUS. From start-ups to some of the

                                    world's most successful companies, see how others are incorporating enterprise and

                                    open source technologies to achieve their business goals. Get your hands on some of

                                    those tools and technologies you've been hearing about, but haven't had the chance to

                                    try (Rust anyone?).</p></li>

                            <li><p>10 years of DEVNEXUS excellence. Through our long history of providing knowledge to

                                    software engineers, developers, IT practitioners, and others, we've learned what's

                                    important, which subjects go together, and how to teach them. Every year the number of

                                    quality proposals we receive for DEVNEXUS far exceeds the number of speaking slots

                                    available, making it easy for us to select the best and most relevant topics for

                                    DEVNEXUS attendees.</p></li></ol>
